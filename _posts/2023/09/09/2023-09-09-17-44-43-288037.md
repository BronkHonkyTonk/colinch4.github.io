In JavaScript, **class methods** are functions defined on a class that can be called without instantiating the class. Unlike **instance methods**, which are called on an instance of a class, class methods are called on the class itself.

To define a class method in JavaScript, you can use the `static` keyword. This keyword indicates that the method is attached directly to the class and not to the instances of the class. Let's look at an example:

```javascript
class Circle {
  constructor(radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  static calculateArea(radius) {
    return Math.PI * radius * radius;
  }
}

const circle1 = new Circle(3);
console.log(circle1.calculateArea()); // Error: circle1.calculateArea is not a function
console.log(Circle.calculateArea(3)); // 28.274333882308138
```

In the example above, we have a `Circle` class with a constructor method and a `calculateArea` class method. The constructor initializes the `radius` property of the instance, while the `calculateArea` method calculates and returns the area of a circle.

Note that when we try to call the `calculateArea` method on an instance of the `Circle` class (`circle1`), we get an error because class methods are not accessible on instances. However, when we call the `calculateArea` method directly on the `Circle` class, it returns the correct result.

Class methods can be useful for performing operations that don't require any data specific to a particular instance. They provide a way to encapsulate utility functions related to the class.

It's important to remember that class methods do not have access to the `this` keyword, because they are not bound to any instance. Therefore, you cannot access instance-specific properties or methods from within a class method.

In conclusion, class methods in JavaScript allow you to define functions that are associated with a class itself rather than its instances. They are called on the class directly and can be useful for encapsulating utility functions or operations that don't require instance-specific data.
