In JavaScript, we often come across situations where we need to check if a variable or property is **null** or **undefined** and provide a default value in case it is. Traditionally, we used the logical OR operator (`||`) to achieve this. However, the **Nullish Coalescing Operator** (`??`) provides a more concise and accurate way to handle this situation.

## Introduction to the Nullish Coalescing Operator

The **Nullish Coalescing Operator** (`??`) is a new addition to JavaScript introduced in the ECMAScript 2020 (ES11) specification. It serves as a shorthand operator to provide a default value if the left-hand side expression is either null or undefined.

Unlike the logical OR operator (`||`), which considers falsy values such as `0`, `""`, `NaN`, and `false`, the Nullish Coalescing Operator only checks for **null** and **undefined** values. This makes it more suitable for scenarios where we want to distinguish between **null**/ **undefined** and other falsy values.

## Usage Examples

Let's look at some examples to better understand the usage of the Nullish Coalescing Operator:

1. Using the Nullish Coalescing Operator with variables:

```javascript
let name = null;
let defaultName = "John Doe";
let result = name ?? defaultName;

console.log(result); // Output: "John Doe"
```

In this example, the value of `name` is **null**, so the Nullish Coalescing Operator assigns the `defaultName` to the `result`.

2. Using the Nullish Coalescing Operator with properties:

```javascript
const data = {
  name: null,
  age: 25
};

let result = data.name ?? "Unknown";

console.log(result); // Output: "Unknown"
```

Here, even though the `name` property exists in the `data` object, its value is **null**. The Nullish Coalescing Operator assigns the default value of "Unknown" to the `result`.

3. Using the Nullish Coalescing Operator with function arguments:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  name = name ?? "Anonymous";
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet(); // Output: "Hello, Anonymous!"
greet("John"); // Output: "Hello, John!"
```

In this example, if the `name` parameter is **null** or **undefined**, the Nullish Coalescing Operator assigns the default value of "Anonymous" to the `name` variable inside the `greet` function.

## Conclusion

The Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`) in JavaScript provides a concise and accurate way to handle default values for null or undefined variables or properties. By using this operator, you can simplify your code and make it more readable. It's important to note that the operator is not supported in older versions of JavaScript, so make sure to check for compatibility before using it in your projects.
