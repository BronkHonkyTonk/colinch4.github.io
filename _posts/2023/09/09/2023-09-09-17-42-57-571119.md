In JavaScript, class-based inheritance allows us to create classes that inherit properties and methods from other classes. The concept of class-based inheritance is important in object-oriented programming as it promotes code reusability and modularity. In this blog post, we will explore how to achieve class-based inheritance in JavaScript.

## Creating Base Class

To start with class-based inheritance, we need to create a base class. This class will contain the common properties and methods that will be inherited by the derived classes. Let's create a `Shape` class as an example:

```javascript
class Shape {
  constructor(color) {
    this.color = color;
  }

  getColor() {
    return this.color;
  }

  draw() {
    console.log("Drawing a shape");
  }
}
```

The `Shape` class has a constructor that accepts a `color` parameter and assigns it to the instance variable `color`. It also has `getColor()` and `draw()` methods which can be used by the derived classes.

## Creating Derived Classes

To create a derived class that inherits from the base class, we use the `extends` keyword. Let's create a `Circle` class that inherits from the `Shape` class:

```javascript
class Circle extends Shape {
  constructor(radius, color) {
    super(color);
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  getRadius() {
    return this.radius;
  }

  draw() {
    console.log(`Drawing a circle with radius ${this.radius}`);
  }
}
```

The `Circle` class extends the `Shape` class using the `extends` keyword. It also has a constructor that accepts a `radius` parameter. Inside the constructor, we call the `super` keyword to invoke the constructor of the base class. This is necessary to initialize the inherited properties. The `Circle` class also has a `getRadius()` method and overrides the `draw()` method with a specific implementation.

## Using the Classes

Now, let's see how we can create objects of the derived classes and use their inherited properties and methods:

```javascript
const circle = new Circle(5, "red");
console.log(circle.getColor());  // Output: red
console.log(circle.getRadius());  // Output: 5
circle.draw();  // Output: Drawing a circle with radius 5
```

We create a `circle` object using the `Circle` class constructor. We can access the inherited `getColor()` method from the `Shape` class, as well as the `getRadius()` and `draw()` methods specific to the `Circle` class.

## Conclusion

Class-based inheritance is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows us to create complex and hierarchical class structures. By leveraging class-based inheritance, we can write efficient and modular code. In this blog post, we learned how to create a base class and derived classes, and how to use inherited properties and methods. Understanding and utilizing class-based inheritance is crucial for building scalable and maintainable JavaScript applications.
