When writing unit tests in Python using the **unittest** framework, it is important to follow a consistent naming convention for your test cases. This makes it easier to understand and organize your tests, especially when you have a large number of them.

## 1. Naming Style

The **unittest** framework follows the **CamelCase** naming convention for test case names. Each word in the test case name should start with an uppercase letter, and there should be no underscores between words.

## 2. Descriptive Names

A good test case name is descriptive and explains what is being tested. It should accurately describe the behavior or purpose of the code being tested. Avoid using generic names like "test_case_1" or "test_function".

For example, if you are testing a function that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart, a good test case name would be `test_calculate_total_price`. This clearly indicates what is being tested.

## 3. Prefixes

To further organize and categorize your test cases, you can use prefixes in the test case names. This helps to group related tests together.

Here are some commonly used prefixes:

- **test_**: This prefix is used for regular test cases.
- **test_\<feature\>**: If you have multiple features being tested, you can use this prefix to indicate which feature the test case belongs to. For example, `test_login`, `test_checkout`.
- **test_\<module\>**: If you have multiple modules being tested, you can use this prefix to indicate which module the test case belongs to. For example, `test_user_module`, `test_order_module`.

## 4. Example

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the naming convention:

```python
import unittest

class CalculatorTest(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_addition(self):
        # Test case for addition
        pass
    
    def test_subtraction(self):
        # Test case for subtraction
        pass
    
    def test_multiply(self):
        # Test case for multiplication
        pass
    
    def test_divide(self):
        # Test case for division
        pass
```

In this example, the test cases are named using the **CamelCase** convention, starting with the prefix **test_**. Each test case name clearly indicates the operation being tested.

Following a consistent naming convention for your test cases will help you and other developers easily understand and maintain your tests. It promotes readability and ensures a standardized approach to test case naming in your Python projects.
