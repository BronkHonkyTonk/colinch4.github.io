Seaborn is a popular data visualization library in Python that is built on top of matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating beautiful and informative statistical graphics. In this blog post, we will explore how to customize plots in seaborn based on specific conditions.

## Setting a Global Plot Style

Seaborn comes with a set of predefined plot styles that you can apply to your plots. This allows you to easily change the default appearance of your graphs, making them more visually appealing. To set the global plot style, you can use the `set_style()` function in seaborn.

```python
import seaborn as sns

# Set the global plot style
sns.set_style("darkgrid")
```

The `set_style()` function accepts various styles as a parameter, such as "darkgrid", "whitegrid", "dark", "white", and "ticks". Choose a style that fits the overall theme of your project or personal preference.

## Styling Specific Plots Based on Conditions

Seaborn provides flexibility in customizing specific plots based on conditions. Let's explore some common scenarios and how to apply styles based on the condition.

### Changing Line Colors in Line Plots

You can change the line color in a line plot based on a specific condition using the `color` parameter in the `lineplot()` function. For example, you can set the line color to red if the value is above a threshold and blue if it is below.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a line plot
sns.lineplot(x="x", y="y", data=data, color=["red" if val > 0.5 else "blue" for val in data["y"]])

plt.show()
```

### Customizing Bar Colors in Bar Plots

In bar plots, you can customize the bar color based on a condition using the `color` parameter in the `barplot()` function. For instance, you can change the bar color to green if the value is positive and red if it is negative.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a bar plot
sns.barplot(x="x", y="y", data=data, color=["green" if val > 0 else "red" for val in data["y"]])

plt.show()
```

### Modifying Scatter Plot Markers

To modify the scatter plot markers based on certain conditions, you can use the `marker` parameter in the `scatterplot()` function. For example, you can use a circle marker if the value is above a threshold and a square marker if it is below.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a scatter plot
sns.scatterplot(x="x", y="y", data=data, marker=["o" if val > 0.5 else "s" for val in data["y"]])

plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to customize plots in seaborn based on specific conditions. We learned how to set a global plot style using `set_style()` and how to style specific plots based on conditions like line colors in line plots, bar colors in bar plots, and markers in scatter plots. Customizing the plot style can make your visualizations more engaging and help convey your data's message effectively. Seaborn's flexibility allows you to create stylish and informative plots with ease.
