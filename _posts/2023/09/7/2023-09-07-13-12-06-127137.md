To use the `sys.is_finalizing()` function, you need to import the `sys` module:

```python
import sys
```

Once you have imported the module, you can call the `is_finalizing()` function to check if the interpreter is in the finalization phase:

```python
if sys.is_finalizing():
    print("The interpreter is finalizing.")
else:
    print("The interpreter is not finalizing.")
```

The `is_finalizing()` function returns `True` if the interpreter is finalizing, and `False` otherwise. You can use this information to perform different actions or handle specific scenarios accordingly.

It's important to note that the `is_finalizing()` function is available in Python 3.10 and above. If you are using an older version of Python, this function may not be available.

By using `sys.is_finalizing()`, you can determine if the Python interpreter is in the process of shutting down or finalizing. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to perform cleanup operations or handle the finalization phase differently.
