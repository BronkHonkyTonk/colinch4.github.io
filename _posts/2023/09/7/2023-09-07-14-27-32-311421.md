Moviepy is a Python library that allows us to work with video files, including various operations such as editing, concatenation, and manipulation. One common task in video processing is adjusting the frames per second (FPS) of a video file. In this blog post, we will explore how to change the FPS of a video using Moviepy in Python.

## Installation

Before we begin, we need to install Moviepy. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```python
pip install moviepy
```

## Changing the FPS of a Video File

Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and loading the video file:

```python
import moviepy.editor as mp

video = mp.VideoFileClip('path/to/video.mp4')
```

Next, we can change the FPS of the video using the `set_fps` method:

```python
new_fps = 30  # desired FPS
video = video.set_fps(new_fps)
```

We can also change the speed of the video by adjusting the duration of each frame. For example, to double the speed of the video, we can set the FPS to twice the original FPS:

```python
new_fps = video.fps * 2
video = video.set_fps(new_fps)
```

After changing the FPS, we can save the modified video to a new file:

```python
output_path = 'path/to/output.mp4'
video.write_videofile(output_path)
```

## Complete Example

Here's a complete example that combines all the steps:

```python
import moviepy.editor as mp

def change_fps(input_path, output_path, new_fps):
    # Load the video
    video = mp.VideoFileClip(input_path)

    # Set the new FPS
    video = video.set_fps(new_fps)

    # Save the modified video
    video.write_videofile(output_path)

# Usage
input_path = 'path/to/video.mp4'
output_path = 'path/to/output.mp4'
new_fps = 30

change_fps(input_path, output_path, new_fps)
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/video.mp4'` with the actual path to your input video file, and `'path/to/output.mp4'` with the desired output path.

By changing the FPS of a video using Moviepy in Python, we can create slow-motion or fast-motion effects, or simply adjust the playback speed of a video to our liking. Moviepy provides a convenient and straightforward way to perform such operations with minimal code.

I hope you found this blog post helpful in understanding how to adjust the FPS of a video using Moviepy in Python. Happy video processing!
