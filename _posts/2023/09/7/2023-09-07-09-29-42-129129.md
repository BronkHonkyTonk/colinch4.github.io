To save a matplotlib graph as an image, we can use the `savefig()` function provided by matplotlib. This function allows us to specify the name and format of the image file.

Let's start by installing matplotlib if you haven't already:

```python
pip install matplotlib
```

Now, let's create a simple graph using matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]

# Plot the data
plt.plot(x, y)

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('Sample Graph')

# Save the graph as an image
plt.savefig('graph.png', format='png')
```

In the above code, we first import the `pyplot` module from matplotlib. Then, we define some sample data for the x and y axes. After that, we plot the data using the `plot()` function.

Next, we add labels and a title to the graph using the `xlabel()`, `ylabel()`, and `title()` functions, respectively.

Finally, we save the graph as an image by calling the `savefig()` function and passing in the name of the file (`graph.png`) and the format of the image (`png`).

After running the code, you will find the `graph.png` file in the same directory. You can open it to see the saved graph.

You can also specify a different format for the image by changing the `format` parameter in the `savefig()` function. Some common image formats you can use include `png`, `jpg`, `svg`, etc.

That's it! You have successfully saved a matplotlib graph as an image in Python. This can be a useful skill to have when working with data visualization tasks or generating images for presentations or reports.
