To illustrate how to use `sys.base_prefix`, consider the following example:

```python
import sys

base_prefix = sys.base_prefix
print(f"The base prefix is: {base_prefix}")
```

In this example, we import the `sys` module and then access the `base_prefix` attribute using `sys.base_prefix`. We then print the value of `base_prefix` using an f-string.

When you run this code, you will see the base prefix outputted to the console. The base prefix represents the root location of the Python installation. It can be helpful in various scenarios, such as when you need to determine the path to the Python executable or when you are working with libraries and want to ensure you are using the correct installation.

It is important to note that `sys.base_prefix` is different from `sys.prefix`. While `sys.base_prefix` returns the base prefix of the Python installation, `sys.prefix` returns the prefix used for installing the libraries and packages.

In summary, `sys.base_prefix` is a valuable attribute in Python that allows you to retrieve the base prefix of the current Python installation. It can be beneficial when working with virtual environments or when you need to determine the path to the Python executable.
