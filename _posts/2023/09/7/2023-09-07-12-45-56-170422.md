Here's an example code snippet demonstrating the usage of `os.getppid()`:

```python
import os

# Get the parent process ID
parent_pid = os.getppid()

# Print the parent process ID
print(f"Parent Process ID (PID): {parent_pid}")
```

The `os.getppid()` function returns an integer representing the PID of the parent process. By storing this value in the `parent_pid` variable, you can perform further operations or log the information as needed.

Keep in mind that the parent process ID may differ depending on the operating system and the execution environment in which your Python program is running. Therefore, the output may vary in different scenarios.

Knowing the parent process ID can be advantageous when working with multi-process systems, analyzing system behavior, or debugging complex applications.
