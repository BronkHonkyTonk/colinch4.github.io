### Installing `mongoengine`

To get started with `mongoengine`, you need to install it using pip:

```
pip install mongoengine
```

### Connecting to MongoDB

The first step is to establish a connection to your MongoDB server. `mongoengine` provides a `connect` method for this:

```python
from mongoengine import connect

connect('mydatabase')
```

Here, `'mydatabase'` is the name of your MongoDB database. If the database doesn't exist, `mongoengine` will create it automatically.

### Defining Document Schema

In `mongoengine`, data is represented as documents. Each document corresponds to a collection in MongoDB. You can define a document schema using Python classes:

```python
from mongoengine import Document, StringField, DateTimeField

class User(Document):
    name = StringField(required=True)
    email = StringField(required=True)
    created_at = DateTimeField(default=datetime.datetime.now)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

In the example above, we defined a `User` document with three fields: `name`, `email`, and `created_at`. The `required=True` attribute specifies that these fields are mandatory. The `default` attribute defines the default value for `created_at` field.

### Querying and Filtering Data

Once you have defined your document schema, you can perform CRUD operations on your MongoDB data. For example, to query all users from the `User` collection, you can use the `objects` attribute:

```python
users = User.objects().all()
for user in users:
    print(user)
```

`objects()` returns a QuerySet, which allows you to filter and manipulate the query results easily. For instance, to find users created after a specific date, you can use the `gt` (greater than) operator:

```python
from datetime import datetime

recent_users = User.objects(created_at__gt=datetime(2022, 1, 1)).all()
for user in recent_users:
    print(user)
```

### Real-time Data Processing

Real-time data processing involves handling streams of data with low latency. With `mongoengine`, you can achieve this by leveraging features like change streams and triggers offered by MongoDB.

Change streams allow you to **watch** a collection and receive real-time notifications whenever any changes occur. You can define a change stream using `mongoengine` as follows:

```python
from mongoengine import collection

@collection(User._get_collection_name())
def on_user_changed(change):
    print("User changed:", change)
```

The `on_user_changed` function is the callback that will be triggered whenever a change occurs in the `User` collection. Here, you can perform any real-time processing you require.

To start listening for changes, you can use the `watch` method:

```python
User.watch(callback=on_user_changed)
```

This sets up the change stream and starts listening for real-time changes. Now, whenever a document in the `User` collection is inserted, updated, or deleted, the `on_user_changed` function will be executed.

### Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how `mongoengine` can be used for real-time data processing with MongoDB in Python. We discussed connecting to MongoDB, defining document schema, querying data, and implementing real-time processing using change streams. `mongoengine` provides a straightforward and convenient way to interact with MongoDB and handle real-time data efficiently.
