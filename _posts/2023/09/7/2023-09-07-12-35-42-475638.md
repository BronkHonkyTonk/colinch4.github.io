To create a new directory using `os.mkdir()`, you need to pass in the path of the directory you want to create as a parameter. Here's an example:

```python
import os

# Specify the path of the new directory
new_directory_path = '/path/to/new/directory'

# Create the new directory
os.mkdir(new_directory_path)
```

In the code above, we first import the `os` module. Then, we specify the path where we want to create the new directory by assigning it to the `new_direcetory_path` variable. Finally, we call the `os.mkdir()` function and pass in the path to create the directory.

Important things to note:
- Make sure the path you provide is valid and doesn't contain any invalid characters.
- If the directory already exists, `os.mkdir()` will raise a `FileExistsError`. So, it's a good practice to check if the directory exists before creating it.

You can use `os.path.exists()` function to check if a directory already exists, like this:

```python
if not os.path.exists(new_directory_path):
    os.mkdir(new_directory_path)
```

This will prevent any errors if you try to create a directory that already exists.

Creating a new directory using `os.mkdir()` is a simple and straightforward process. With this function, you can easily manage file system operations in your Python projects.
