When working with APIs or fetching data from a website, making GET requests is a common task. In Python, the `requests` library provides a simple and intuitive way to send GET requests and handle the responses.

## Installing requests library

Before we start making GET requests, we need to make sure that the `requests` library is installed. If you don't have it already, you can install it by running the following command:

```python
pip install requests
```

## Making a basic GET request

To make a GET request using the `requests` library, you simply need to call the `get()` function and provide the URL of the resource you want to fetch. Here's an example:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
```

In the above code snippet, we import the `requests` library and then use the `requests.get()` function to make a GET request to the specified URL. The response from the server is stored in the `response` variable.

## Handling the response

Once the GET request is made, you can access the data returned by the server using various properties and methods provided by the `response` object. Here are a few commonly used ones:

- `response.status_code` - Returns the status code of the HTTP response (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found).
- `response.text` - Returns the response content as a plain string.
- `response.json()` - Returns the response content as a JSON object.

For example, to print the status code and the response content, you can do the following:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

print('Status code:', response.status_code)
print('Response content:', response.text)
```

## Handling errors

In addition to handling successful responses, it's also important to handle errors that may occur during the GET request. The `requests` library provides the `raise_for_status()` method, which raises an exception if the GET request was unsuccessful. Here's an example:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/invalid-endpoint')
response.raise_for_status()
```

The `raise_for_status()` method will raise an exception if the GET request resulted in an error (e.g., 404 Not Found). You can then catch and handle the exception as needed.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned about the basic concepts and usage of making GET requests using the `requests` library in Python. We covered how to install the library, make a GET request, handle the response, and handle errors. With this basic knowledge, you can start fetching data from APIs and websites in your Python projects.
