In modern web development, **WebSocket** has gained popularity for enabling real-time, bi-directional communication between a client and a server. It is an alternative to traditional HTTP communication, providing a more efficient and continuous connection.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to establish a WebSocket connection using Python's **Requests** library, giving you the ability to incorporate WebSocket communication in your Python applications.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:

1. Python installed on your machine (version 3.6 or higher)
2. The Requests library installed (`pip install requests`)

## Establishing a WebSocket Connection

1. Start by importing the necessary libraries:
   
```python
import requests
from websocket import create_connection
```

2. Define the URL of the WebSocket server you want to connect to:

```python
ws_url = "wss://your-websocket-server.com"
```

3. Next, create a `GET` request to initiate the WebSocket connection:

```python
response = requests.get(ws_url)
```

4. Retrieve the **WebSocket URL** from the response headers:

```python
websocket_url = response.headers.get('webSocketLocation')
```

5. Finally, use the `create_connection` function from `websocket` library to establish the WebSocket connection:

```python
ws = create_connection(websocket_url)
```

## Sending and Receiving WebSocket Messages

Congratulations! You have successfully established a WebSocket connection. Now let's learn how to send and receive messages.

### Sending Messages

To send a message to the server, use the `send` method of the WebSocket object:

```python
message = "Hello, server!"
ws.send(message)
```

### Receiving Messages

To receive messages from the server, use the `recv` method of the WebSocket object:

```python
while True:
    received_message = ws.recv()
    print("Received message:", received_message)
```

## Disconnecting from the WebSocket Server

To gracefully close the WebSocket connection, use the `close` method:

```python
ws.close()
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to establish a WebSocket connection in Python using the Requests library. You also learned how to send and receive messages over the WebSocket connection. WebSocket enables real-time communication, making it a valuable tool in building interactive and responsive web applications.

Remember to check the documentation of the WebSocket server you're connecting to for specific message formats and functionalities. Happy coding!
