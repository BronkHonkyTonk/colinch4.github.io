To use `sys.stdin`, you need to import the `sys` module at the beginning of your code:

```python
import sys
```

Once you have imported the `sys` module, you can read input using the `stdin` object. Here is an example that prompts the user to enter their name and then prints it:

```python
import sys

# Read input from the user
name = sys.stdin.readline()

# Print the entered name
print("Hello, " + name)
```

In the above code, we use the `readline()` method of `sys.stdin` to read the input from the user. The `readline()` method reads a line from input, including the newline character at the end. If you want to remove the newline character, you can use the `strip()` method.

```python
import sys

# Read input from the user
name = sys.stdin.readline().strip()

# Print the entered name
print("Hello, " + name)
```

The `strip()` method removes any leading or trailing whitespace characters, including the newline character.

You can use `sys.stdin` to read multiple inputs as well. For example, if you want to read two numbers from the user and add them, you can do the following:

```python
import sys

# Read the first number
num1 = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

# Read the second number
num2 = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

# Add the numbers
result = num1 + num2

# Print the result
print("The sum is:", result)
```

In the above code, we read two numbers from the user and convert them to integers using the `int()` function. Then, we add the numbers and print the result.

Using `sys.stdin` allows you to interactively read input from the user during runtime, making your programs more dynamic and versatile.
