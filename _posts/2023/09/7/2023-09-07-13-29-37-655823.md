Pillow is a powerful image processing library in Python that allows you to perform various operations on images. One such operation is exchanging colors in an image. In this blog post, we will explore how to use Pillow to swap colors in an image.

## Installation
Before we start, make sure you have Pillow installed. You can install it using pip:
```
pip install pillow
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Import the necessary libraries
To begin, import the required libraries - `PIL` (Pillow) and `Image` from `PIL` module.

```python
from PIL import Image
```

### Step 2: Load the image
Next, load the image on which you want to exchange colors using the `open()` function. Make sure the image is in the same directory as your Python script.

```python
image = Image.open("image.jpg")
```

### Step 3: Exchange the colors
Now, let's say we want to swap the red color pixels with blue color pixels and vice versa. To do this, we can use the `convert()` method to change each pixel's color to the desired color.

```python
def swap_colors(pixel):
    # Get the RGB values of the pixel
    r, g, b = pixel

    # Swap the red and blue color values
    return (b, g, r)

# Apply the swap_colors() function to each pixel in the image
image = image.convert("RGB")
width, height = image.size
for x in range(width):
    for y in range(height):
        pixel = image.getpixel((x, y))
        swapped_pixel = swap_colors(pixel)
        image.putpixel((x, y), swapped_pixel)
```

### Step 4: Save and display the modified image
Finally, you can save the modified image using the `save()` method and display it using the `show()` method.

```python
image.save("modified_image.jpg")
image.show()
```

That's it! You have successfully swapped the colors in your image using Pillow in Python.

## Conclusion
Pillow provides a convenient way to manipulate colors in images using Python. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily swap colors in an image. Experiment with different color combinations to achieve unique visual effects.
