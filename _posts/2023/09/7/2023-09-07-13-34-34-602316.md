Imageio is a powerful Python library that allows you to read and write a wide range of image file formats. Color mapping, also known as color manipulation or color transformation, is a technique used to modify the colors of an image based on a predefined mapping scheme. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform color mapping using the imageio library in Python.

## Installation
Before we dive into the code examples, let's make sure we have imageio installed. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```shell
pip install imageio
```

With imageio installed, we are ready to start mapping colors in our images.

## Color mapping using imageio
To perform color mapping, we first need an image to work with. Let's assume we have an image named "input.jpg" in the same directory as our Python script. We will read the image using imageio and then apply color mapping to it.

```python
import imageio

# Read the input image
input_image = imageio.imread('input.jpg')

# Define a color mapping function
def color_mapping(pixel):
    # TODO: Implement your color mapping logic here
    # Example: Invert the colors
    return 255 - pixel

# Apply color mapping to each pixel of the image
mapped_image = np.array([color_mapping(pixel) for pixel in input_image])

# Save the mapped image
imageio.imsave('mapped.jpg', mapped_image)
```

In the code snippet above, we start by importing the `imageio` library. Next, we read the input image using the `imread` function and store it in the `input_image` variable. 

We then define a color mapping function `color_mapping`, which takes a pixel value as input and performs some manipulation on it. In this example, we are simply inverting the colors by subtracting the pixel value from 255.

Next, we use a list comprehension to apply the `color_mapping` function to each pixel of the input image, resulting in a new mapped image stored in the `mapped_image` variable. Finally, we save the mapped image using the `imsave` function.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we explored how to perform color mapping using the imageio library in Python. Imageio provides a convenient way to read and write images, making it easy to apply color transformations to your images. With the help of the provided code example, you can now start experimenting with various color mapping techniques to enhance your images.

Remember to experiment with different color mapping functions to achieve the desired effect. Whether you want to invert colors, adjust brightness, or create custom color schemes, imageio gives you the flexibility to accomplish it. Happy coding!
