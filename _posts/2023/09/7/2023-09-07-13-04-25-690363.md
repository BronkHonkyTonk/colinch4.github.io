In Python, the `os.access()` function can be utilized to check the permissions or access rights of a file. This function is part of the `os` module, which provides a way to interact with the operating system.

The `os.access()` function takes two parameters: the path of the file or directory, and the mode of access for which the permission needs to be checked. It returns `True` if the access is allowed, `False` otherwise.

Here is the syntax for using the `os.access()` function:

```python
import os

path = '/path/to/file.txt'
mode = os.R_OK  # Read permission

if os.access(path, mode):
    print("Read access is allowed for the file.")
else:
    print("Read access is not allowed for the file.")
```

In the above example, we are checking if the file located at `'/path/to/file.txt'` has read access. We pass the `os.R_OK` constant as the mode, which represents the read permission. If the file has read access, it will print "Read access is allowed for the file." Otherwise, it will print "Read access is not allowed for the file."

Here are the different modes that can be passed to `os.access()`:

- `os.F_OK`: Checks if the file exists
- `os.R_OK`: Checks if read access is allowed
- `os.W_OK`: Checks if write access is allowed
- `os.X_OK`: Checks if execute access is allowed

You can combine multiple modes using the bitwise or (`|`) operator. For example, `os.R_OK | os.W_OK` checks if read and write access are allowed.

It's important to note that the `os.access()` function only checks the permissions of the current user. It doesn't take into account other factors such as ownership or group permissions.

So, the next time you need to verify the permissions of a file in your Python script, consider using the `os.access()` function for a straightforward solution.
