In this blog post, we will explore how to add a watermark to images using the `imageio` library in Python. Watermarking images is a common practice to protect the copyright of images or to add branding elements to them. 

## Installing imageio

In order to use `imageio` library, you need to install it first. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install imageio
```

## Adding Watermark

To add a watermark to an image, you need to follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import imageio
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
```

2. Load the image and the watermark image:

```python
image = imageio.imread('input_image.jpg')
watermark = imageio.imread('watermark_image.png')
```

3. Convert the watermark image to grayscale:

```python
gray_watermark = np.dot(watermark[..., :3], [0.2989, 0.5870, 0.1140])
```

4. Set the position where you want to place the watermark:

```python
x_position = image.shape[1] - gray_watermark.shape[1] - 10
y_position = image.shape[0] - gray_watermark.shape[0] - 10
```

5. Add the watermark to the image:

```python
image[y_position:image.shape[0]-10, x_position:image.shape[1]-10] += gray_watermark
```

6. Save the image with the watermark:

```python
output_image = Image.fromarray(image)
output_image.save('output_image.jpg')
```

That's it! By following these simple steps, you can easily add a watermark to your images using `imageio` library in Python.
