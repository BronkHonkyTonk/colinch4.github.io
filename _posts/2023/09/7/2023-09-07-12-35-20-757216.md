Changing the current working directory can be helpful when you want to navigate to a different directory to perform certain tasks or access files. The `os.chdir()` function takes a single argument, which is the path to the directory you want to change to.

```python
import os

# Get the current working directory
current_dir = os.getcwd()
print("Current directory:", current_dir)

# Change the directory to a new path
new_dir = '/path/to/new/directory'
os.chdir(new_dir)

# Verify the directory has changed
updated_dir = os.getcwd()
print("Updated directory:", updated_dir)
```

In the example above, we first use the `os.getcwd()` function to get the current working directory and print it out. Then, we use `os.chdir()` to change the directory to a new path specified by `/path/to/new/directory`. Finally, we use `os.getcwd()` again to see the updated working directory.

It is important to note that when using `os.chdir()`, the new directory path should be a valid path on your operating system. Otherwise, an error will occur. Additionally, make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the directory.

Changing the directory using `os.chdir()` can be particularly useful when working with file I/O, running scripts that require specific file locations, or organizing your project directories.

Remember, the `os` module in Python offers various functions to interact with the operating system, and `os.chdir()` is just one of the many capabilities it provides. Be sure to explore the module's documentation to fully utilize its potential.
