MongoEngine is a Python Object-Document Mapper (ODM) that provides a high-level API for interacting with MongoDB. It allows for easy modeling and manipulation of data, making it a popular choice for working with MongoDB in Python applications.

One of the key features of MongoEngine is the ability to validate fields in MongoDB documents. Field validation ensures that the data stored in the database meets certain criteria, making it more reliable and consistent. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform field validation using MongoEngine in Python.

### Installation

Before we dive into field validation, let's quickly install MongoEngine using `pip`:

```
pip install mongoengine
```

### Defining a Document

To define a MongoDB document with field validation, we need to create a Python class that inherits from the `mongoengine.Document` class. Let's consider an example where we have a `User` document with the following fields:

- `name` (String)
- `age` (Integer, between 18 and 65)
- `email` (String, with a valid email format)

Here's how we can define the `User` document in MongoEngine:

```python
from mongoengine import Document, StringField, IntField, EmailField, ValidationError

class User(Document):
    name = StringField(required=True)
    age = IntField(min_value=18, max_value=65)
    email = EmailField()

    def validate(self):
        if not self.name.isalpha():
            raise ValidationError("Name can only contain alphabetic characters")

        super().validate()
```

In the code above, we imported the necessary field types from `mongoengine`. We defined the `name` field as a `StringField` with `required=True`, which means it must have a value. The `age` field is an `IntField` with `min_value` and `max_value` attributes, restricting it to be between 18 and 65. The `email` field is an `EmailField`, which automatically validates the input against a regular expression pattern for email addresses.

The `validate` method is a built-in mongoengine method that allows you to perform additional custom validation logic. In this example, we check if the `name` contains only alphabetic characters and raise a `ValidationError` if not. Finally, we call the super validation to run the default validation process.

### Saving Documents

To save a document, we first create an instance of the `User` class and set its field values. We can then call the `save` method to store it in the database. Here's an example:

```python
user = User(name="John Doe", age=25, email="johndoe@example.com")
user.save()
```

If any of the field values violate the validation rules, a `ValidationError` will be raised, preventing the document from being saved.

### Querying Documents

We can also perform query operations on documents that have field validation. For example, to find all users whose age is greater than or equal to 21, we can use the `User.objects` attribute along with the `gte` (greater than or equal to) operator:

```python
users = User.objects(age__gte=21)
```

### Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to perform field validation using MongoEngine in Python. We saw how to define a document with field validation rules, save documents while enforcing the rules, and perform queries on validated documents.

Field validation in MongoDB helps maintain data integrity and consistency. It ensures that the stored data meets the desired criteria, reducing the chances of errors and improving the overall quality of the database.

With MongoEngine's intuitive API and powerful validation features, working with MongoDB in Python becomes a breeze. So the next time you're working with MongoDB, consider using MongoEngine for seamless document validation.
