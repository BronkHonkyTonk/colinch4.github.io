When using subprocess module in Python, you have the ability to execute external commands and interact with them. One useful feature of the subprocess module is the ability to set the priority of the executed command.

In this blog post, we will focus on setting the **IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS** priority with the subprocess module in Python. We will explore what **IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS** means and how to use it.

## What is IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS?

**IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS** is a priority level available in the Windows operating system. It is used to set the priority of a process to the lowest possible level without suspending it.

When a process is assigned the **IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS**, it will only use the available CPU resources when no other processes with higher priority need them. This means that the process will only run when the system is not busy with other tasks.

Using **IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS** can be beneficial in situations where you have a background process that doesn't require immediate attention and can run without affecting the performance of other critical tasks.

## Setting IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS with subprocess

To set the **IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS** with subprocess in Python, you need to use the `subprocess.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` flag along with the `subprocess.CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE` flag.

Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import subprocess

command = "my_background_task.exe"

startupinfo = subprocess.STARTUPINFO()
startupinfo.dwFlags |= subprocess.STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW

creationflags = subprocess.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP | subprocess.CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE | subprocess.IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS

subprocess.Popen(command, startupinfo=startupinfo, creationflags=creationflags)
```

In the above code, we use the `subprocess.Popen` function to start the background process. We pass the `command` as the argument and also set the `startupinfo` and `creationflags` parameters.

The `subprocess.STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW` flag is used to hide the console window of the background process. The `subprocess.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` and `subprocess.CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE` flags are used to create a new process group and console for the background process. Finally, we specify the `subprocess.IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS` flag to set the priority of the process to **IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS**.

By using the above code, the background process will run with the **IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS** priority, ensuring it doesn't interfere with other higher priority tasks.

## Conclusion

Setting the **IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS** priority with subprocess in Python can be useful when dealing with background tasks that shouldn't impact the performance of the system. By utilizing the appropriate flags and priority class, you can ensure that your background process runs efficiently in a non-intrusive manner.

Remember to adjust the command variable in the code snippet according to your specific task.
