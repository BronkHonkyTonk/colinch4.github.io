Mongoengine is a Python Object-Document Mapping (ODM) library for working with MongoDB databases. It provides a high-level, object-oriented API for interacting with MongoDB and simplifies the process of building MongoDB-based applications.

One powerful feature of MongoDB is text searching, which allows you to search for documents based on the contents of their fields. In this blog post, we will explore how to configure and perform full-text searches using Mongoengine.

### Installing Required Libraries
Before we start, make sure you have the `mongoengine` library installed. You can install it using `pip`:

```python
pip install mongoengine
```

### Defining a Document
To perform text searches, we need to define a Mongoengine Document with a field to search on. Let's say we have a collection called "books" and we want to search for books based on their titles. We can define a document as follows:

```python
from mongoengine import Document, StringField

class Book(Document):
    title = StringField(required=True)
    # ...
```

### Enabling Text Indexing
To enable full-text search on the `title` field, we need to create an index on that field. Here's an example of how to enable text indexing on the `title` field:

```python
Book.create_index([('title', 'text')])
```

This creates a text index on the `title` field, allowing us to perform full-text searches on it.

### Performing Full-Text Search
Once the text index is created, we can use the `search_text` method to perform full-text searches. Here's an example of how to search for books with titles containing a specific keyword:

```python
keyword = "python"
results = Book.objects.search_text(keyword)
```

The `search_text` method returns a `QuerySet` containing the documents that match the given keyword in the text index.

### Sorting Search Results
By default, the search results are sorted by the relevance score. However, you can customize the sorting behavior using the `order_by` method. For example, to sort the results by the `title` field in ascending order, you can do the following:

```python
results = Book.objects.search_text(keyword).order_by('title')
```

### Conclusion
Enabling full-text search in Mongoengine allows you to perform powerful searches based on the contents of your document fields. By creating a text index and using the `search_text` method, you can easily retrieve documents based on keyword matches. This feature is particularly useful when building applications that require sophisticated search capabilities.

In this blog post, we covered how to configure full-text search in Mongoengine and perform searches on a specific field. By exploring the official Mongoengine documentation, you can learn more about its advanced features and leverage the power of MongoDB in your Python applications.
