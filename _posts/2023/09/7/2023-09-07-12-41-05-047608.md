To use `os.path.join()`, you need to import the `os` module in your Python script. Here's an example of how to use `os.path.join()` to combine file path components:

```python
import os

# Define the file path components
directory = "documents"
filename = "file.txt"

# Combine the path components using os.path.join()
file_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)

# Print the combined file path
print(file_path)
```

Output:
```
documents/file.txt  # or documents\file.txt on Windows
```

In the above example, the `os.path.join()` method is used to combine the `directory` and `filename` variables into a single file path. The resulting file path is then printed to the console.

By using `os.path.join()` instead of manually concatenating path components using strings, you ensure that the resulting path will be correct and compatible with the operating system you are running the Python script on.

Keep in mind that `os.path.join()` can accept multiple arguments. For example, if you have multiple subdirectories within the main directory, you can pass them as separate arguments to `os.path.join()`:

```python
import os

# Define the path components
main_directory = "documents"
subdirectory1 = "folder1"
subdirectory2 = "folder2"
filename = "file.txt"

# Combine the path components using os.path.join()
file_path = os.path.join(main_directory, subdirectory1, subdirectory2, filename)

# Print the combined file path
print(file_path)
```

Output:
```
documents/folder1/folder2/file.txt  # or documents\folder1\folder2\file.txt on Windows
```

In the above example, `os.path.join()` is used to combine four path components: `main_directory`, `subdirectory1`, `subdirectory2`, and `filename`.

Using `os.path.join()` allows you to easily manage file paths in a cross-platform way, ensuring your code works correctly regardless of the operating system.
