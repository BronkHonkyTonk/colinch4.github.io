The `subprocess` module in Python allows you to create new processes and interact with their input/output streams. One of the useful classes in this module is `subprocess.Popen`, which represents a running process.

The `args` attribute of a `subprocess.Popen` object holds the command and arguments used to start the process. It's a tuple that contains the full command line to be executed.

## Accessing the `args` Attribute

To access the `args` attribute of a `subprocess.Popen` object, you can simply access it like any other attribute using the dot notation. Here's an example:

```python
import subprocess

# Start a process
process = subprocess.Popen(['ls', '-l', '/'])

# Access the args attribute
print(process.args)
```

In the above example, we create a new `subprocess.Popen` object by running the `ls -l /` command. Then, we access the `args` attribute and print it. The output will be the same as the command line arguments passed to the `Popen` class.

## Modifying the `args` Attribute

The `args` attribute is read-only, so you cannot directly modify it. However, you can create a new `subprocess.Popen` object with different command line arguments if needed.

```python
import subprocess

# Start a process with initial args
initial_args = ['ls', '-l']
process = subprocess.Popen(initial_args)

# Modify the args attribute by creating a new process
new_args = ['ls', '-a']
new_process = subprocess.Popen(new_args)

# Access the args attributes of both processes
print(process.args)      # ['ls', '-l']
print(new_process.args)  # ['ls', '-a']
```

In the above example, we first start a process with initial arguments `['ls', '-l']`. Then, we create a new process with different arguments `['ls', '-a']`. By comparing the `args` attributes of both processes, we can see the changes.

## Conclusion

The `args` attribute of a `subprocess.Popen` object holds the command line arguments used to start a process. It provides a convenient way to access and reference the command that was executed. However, it is read-only, and any modification requires creating a new `subprocess.Popen` object with different arguments.

Remember to import the `subprocess` module at the beginning of your code before using the `Popen` class and its `args` attribute.
