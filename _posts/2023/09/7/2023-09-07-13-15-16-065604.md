In Python, the `subprocess` module allows you to create and manage subprocesses. One of the options available is `subprocess.DETACHED_PROCESS`, which starts a subprocess in a **detached** mode.

When a subprocess is started in detached mode, it is independent of the parent process. It continues executing even if the parent process terminates. This can be useful in situations where you want a process to run in the background or as a daemon.

Here's an example of how to use `subprocess.DETACHED_PROCESS` to start a detached subprocess:

```python
import subprocess

# Command to execute in the subprocess
command = ['python', 'script.py']

# Start the subprocess in detached mode
subprocess.Popen(command, stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL, stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, creationflags=subprocess.DETACHED_PROCESS)
```

In the example above, we're using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to start a new process. The `command` variable contains the command to be executed in the subprocess. In this case, we're running the `script.py` script using the `python` interpreter.

To run the subprocess in detached mode, we pass the `creationflags=subprocess.DETACHED_PROCESS` argument. This tells the `Popen` function to start the subprocess in a detached state.

Additionally, we're redirecting the standard input, output, and error streams of the subprocess to `subprocess.DEVNULL`. This prevents them from being tied to the parent process and allows the subprocess to run independently.

Keep in mind that when running a subprocess in detached mode, you won't have direct control or visibility over its execution. If you need to interact with the subprocess or monitor its output, you may consider using other options from the `subprocess` module, such as `subprocess.PIPE`.

Overall, using `subprocess.DETACHED_PROCESS` can be a powerful tool to start independent subprocesses in Python. It gives you the flexibility of running processes in the background or as daemons, allowing you to perform various tasks simultaneously.
