MongoEngine is a Python Object-Document Mapper (ODM) that simplifies the interaction with MongoDB databases. In this blog post, we will explore how to save and retrieve documents using MongoEngine in Python.

## Installation

Before we get started, make sure you have MongoEngine installed on your machine. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install mongoengine
```

## Saving Documents

To save a document using MongoEngine, we need to define a Model class that inherits from the `mongoengine.Document` class. Let's create a simple example of a `User` document:

```python
from mongoengine import Document, StringField, IntField

class User(Document):
    name = StringField(required=True)
    age = IntField(required=True)
    email = StringField()

    meta = {
        'collection': 'users'
    }
```

In the above code, we created a `User` class with three fields: `name`, `age`, and `email`. The `name` and `age` fields are required, while the `email` field is optional. The `meta` dictionary is used to specify the collection name where the documents will be stored in the MongoDB database.

To save a new user to the database, we can create an instance of the `User` class and call the `save()` method:

```python
user = User(name='John Doe', age=25, email='john.doe@example.com')
user.save()
```

## Retrieving Documents

MongoEngine provides several ways to retrieve documents from the database. We can use the `get()` method to retrieve a single document based on a specific condition:

```python
user = User.objects.get(name='John Doe')
```

In the above code, we use the `objects` attribute of the `User` class to access the collection and call the `get()` method with the desired condition.

We can also use the `filter()` method to retrieve multiple documents that match a certain condition:

```python
users = User.objects.filter(age__gte=30)
```

In the above code, we retrieve all users with an age greater than or equal to 30.

To retrieve all documents in a collection, we can use the `all()` method:

```python
users = User.objects.all()
```

## Conclusion

MongoEngine provides a convenient way to save and retrieve documents in a MongoDB database using Python. In this blog post, we learned how to define a Model class, save documents, and retrieve them based on specific conditions. This is just a basic introduction to MongoEngine, and there are many more features and functionalities available. I encourage you to explore the official documentation to learn more about this powerful ODM.

Happy coding!
