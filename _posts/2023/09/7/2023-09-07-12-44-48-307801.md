In multi-threaded programming, thread scheduling is an important aspect. Python provides a way to control the interval at which threads are switched using the `sys.getswitchinterval()` function. 

When multiple threads are running in a Python program, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. This means that even though multiple threads are created, they are not truly running in parallel but rather taking turns to execute.

The `sys.getswitchinterval()` function returns the interval, in seconds, between thread switching. By default, this interval is set to a small value, ensuring that threads are switched frequently. However, it is possible to modify this interval according to the specific needs of the application. 

## Syntax

```python
import sys

interval = sys.getswitchinterval()
```

## Parameters

The `sys.getswitchinterval()` function does not accept any parameters.

## Return Value

This function returns a floating-point number which represents the thread switching interval in seconds.

## Example Usage

```python
import sys

interval = sys.getswitchinterval()

print(f"The current thread switch interval is {interval} seconds.")
```

Output:

```
The current thread switch interval is 0.005 seconds.
```

In the example above, the `sys.getswitchinterval()` function is used to retrieve the current thread switching interval. The value is then printed to the console.

It is important to note that modifying the thread switching interval should only be done if necessary. Changing this value can have significant impacts on the performance and behavior of the application.
