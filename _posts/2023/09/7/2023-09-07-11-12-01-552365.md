To use the `DecimalField` in mongoengine, you'll need to install mongoengine library first. You can do this by running the following command:

```
pip install mongoengine
```

Now, let's see how we can utilize the `DecimalField` in our code. First, import the necessary modules and create a connection to MongoDB:

```python
from mongoengine import connect, Document, DecimalField

# Establish a connection to MongoDB
connect('my_database')
```

Next, define a document class that represents our MongoDB collection. We'll include a `DecimalField` within this class:

```python
class Product(Document):
    name = StringField(required=True)
    price = DecimalField(precision=2, rounding='ROUND_HALF_UP')
```

In the above example, we create a `Product` document class with two fields: `name` of type `StringField` and `price` of type `DecimalField`. We specify the precision of the decimal number with the `precision` argument, which denotes the number of decimal places. The `rounding` argument specifies the rounding mode for the decimal number.

Now we can create and save documents containing decimal values:

```python
# Create a product
product = Product(name="Cup", price=10.99)
product.save()
```

To retrieve the decimal value from a document, simply access the field as you would with any other field:

```python
# Retrieve the product and print the price
product = Product.objects(name="Cup").first()
print(product.price)  # Output: 10.99
```

The `DecimalField` in mongoengine ensures the precision and accuracy of decimal numbers, making it suitable for applications that require high-precision calculations or financial data storage.

In conclusion, the `DecimalField` offered by mongoengine allows you to store and manipulate decimal numbers with precision in MongoDB. It provides a convenient way to work with decimal data in Python applications while leveraging the benefits of MongoDB's document-oriented database.
