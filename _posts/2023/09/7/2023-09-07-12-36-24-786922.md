When writing Python scripts, we often need to pass command line arguments to our program. The `sys.argv` attribute in Python provides a simple way to access these command line arguments.

### What is `sys.argv`?

In Python, the `sys.argv` variable is a list that contains the command line arguments passed to the script. The first element (`sys.argv[0]`) is the name of the script itself, and the subsequent elements (`sys.argv[1]` onwards) are the arguments passed by the user.

### How to use `sys.argv`

To access the command line arguments using `sys.argv`, we follow these steps:

1. Import the `sys` module:
```python
import sys
```

2. Access the command line arguments using `sys.argv`:
```python
argument1 = sys.argv[1]
argument2 = sys.argv[2]
```

### Example

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the usage of `sys.argv`. Assume we have a Python script called `my_script.py`, which takes two arguments: a file name and a delimiter. We want to print these arguments to the console.

Here is the code for `my_script.py`:

```python
import sys

filename = sys.argv[1]
delimiter = sys.argv[2]

print("File name:", filename)
print("Delimiter:", delimiter)
```

To execute this script with command line arguments, we run the following command:

```
python my_script.py data.txt ","
```

The output would be:

```
File name: data.txt
Delimiter: ,
```

### Conclusion

The `sys.argv` attribute in Python provides a convenient way to access command line arguments passed to a script. By using this attribute, we can enhance the functionality of our scripts and make them more versatile.
