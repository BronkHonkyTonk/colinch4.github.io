To access and display the Python version, you can use the following code:

```python
import sys

print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
```

In the code above, we first import the `sys` module. We then use the `sys.version` attribute to retrieve the Python version information. Finally, we use the `print` function to display the version information.

When you run this code, you will see the Python version displayed in the output. The version string will include the detailed version number and additional information about the compiler and build details.

It is important to note that `sys.version` only retrieves the Python version information at runtime. If you want to perform version checking or use specific version-related features, you can also use the `sys.version_info` attribute. This attribute provides access to the version information as a tuple of integers, allowing you to compare specific version numbers or perform conditional checks.

```python
import sys

if sys.version_info >= (3, 7):
    print("Python version is 3.7 or higher")
else:
    print("Python version is lower than 3.7")
```

In the code snippet above, we check if the Python version is 3.7 or higher using the `sys.version_info` attribute. If the condition is true, we print a corresponding message. Otherwise, we print a different message.

Using the `sys.version` and `sys.version_info` attributes, you can easily obtain and utilize the Python version information in your code. This can help in ensuring compatibility and taking advantage of specific features available in different Python versions.
