In Python, the `subprocess` module provides a way to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. One useful method provided by the `subprocess` module is `Popen.poll()`, which allows us to check the status of a process.

## What is `Popen.poll()`?

`Popen.poll()` is a method of the `Popen` class in the `subprocess` module. It is used to check the status of a child process without blocking. This means that it will not wait for the process to finish before returning the result. Instead, it will immediately return the process's return code if it has completed, or `None` if it is still running.

## How to use `Popen.poll()`?

To use `Popen.poll()`, you first need to create a `Popen` object by calling the `subprocess.Popen()` function. This function takes a list or string of command-line arguments and various other optional parameters. Once you have the `Popen` object, you can call `Popen.poll()` to check its status.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `Popen.poll()`:

```python
import subprocess

# Start a process
process = subprocess.Popen(["python", "my_script.py"])

# Check the status of the process
return_code = process.poll()

if return_code is None:
    print("Process is still running.")
else:
    print(f"Process has completed with return code: {return_code}")
```

In the above example, we use `subprocess.Popen()` to start a new process running the `my_script.py` Python script. We then call `process.poll()` to check the status of the process. If the return code is `None`, it means the process is still running. Otherwise, it has completed, and we print the return code.

## Conclusion

The `subprocess` module in Python provides a convenient way to spawn and control new processes. The `Popen.poll()` method allows us to check the status of a process without blocking. This can be useful when you need to monitor the progress of a long-running external command or handle situations where multiple processes need to be managed concurrently.
