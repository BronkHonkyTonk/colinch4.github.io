When running tests with pytest, it generates a detailed test report with essential information such as test outcomes, durations, and failures. Although the default report format is informative, it might lack customization and styling options. In this blog post, we will explore how to style the pytest test report to make it more visually appealing and easier to read.

## Using pytest-html

One way to style the pytest test report is by using the `pytest-html` plugin. This plugin generates an HTML report that can be customized with CSS styles. To get started, you need to install the `pytest-html` package:

```shell
pip install pytest-html
```

After installing the package, you can generate an HTML report by running pytest with the `--html` option:

```shell
pytest --html=report.html
```

This command will run your tests and generate an HTML report named `report.html`. You can open this file in a browser to view the styled test report.

## Customizing the report style

To customize the style of the pytest test report, you can override the default CSS styles provided by `pytest-html`. You can do this by creating a custom CSS file and linking it to the HTML report.

Here's an example of a custom CSS file that changes the font, background color, and header style:

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
    font-size: 24px;
    font-weight: bold;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```

Save this CSS code in a file named `custom.css`.

To link this custom CSS file to the report, modify the pytest command as follows:

```shell
pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html --css=custom.css
```

The `--self-contained-html` option ensures that the CSS styles are embedded in the HTML file, making it a standalone report. The `--css` option specifies the path to the custom CSS file (`custom.css`).

## Conclusion

By using `pytest-html` and custom CSS styles, you can enhance the visual appearance of the pytest test report. Styling the report makes it more readable and visually appealing, making it easier to analyze the test results. Experiment with different CSS styles to create a test report that best suits your needs.

Remember to continually check the pytest documentation and `pytest-html` documentation for updates and additional features.

Happy testing!
