Moviepy is a powerful Python library for video editing and manipulation. It provides various features to apply effects to videos, such as adding texts, overlays, transitions, and even 3D effects. In this tutorial, we will learn how to apply 3D effects to videos using Moviepy.

## Installing Moviepy

Before we start, make sure you have Moviepy installed. You can install it using pip by running the following command:

```python
pip install moviepy
```

## Applying 3D effects

To apply 3D effects to a video, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Import the necessary modules from Moviepy.
2. Load the input video.
3. Define the 3D effect parameters.
4. Apply the 3D effect to the video.
5. Save the processed video.

Let's go through each step in detail.

### Step 1: Import the necessary modules

First, we need to import the necessary modules from Moviepy. In this example, we will import the `color` and `video` submodules.

```python
from moviepy.video import VideoClip
from moviepy.video.fx import color
```

### Step 2: Load the input video

Next, we need to load the input video on which we want to apply the 3D effect. You can use the `VideoFileClip` function to load the video from a file.

```python
input_video = VideoFileClip('input_video.mp4')
```

Replace `'input_video.mp4'` with the path to your actual video file.

### Step 3: Define the 3D effect parameters

Now, we need to define the parameters for the 3D effect. Moviepy provides the `rotate` function from the `color` submodule to apply rotation in the 3D space. We can pass the rotation angles in degrees to the `rotate` function.

```python
rotation_angles = (30, 45, 0)  # (x-axis, y-axis, z-axis)
```

Replace the rotation angles with your desired values.

### Step 4: Apply the 3D effect to the video

Next, we can apply the 3D effect to the video by calling the `rotate` function on the video clip and passing the rotation angles as arguments.

```python
output_video = input_video.fx(color.rotate, *rotation_angles)
```

### Step 5: Save the processed video

Finally, we can save the processed video to a file using the `write_videofile` function.

```python
output_video.write_videofile('output_video.mp4')
```

Replace `'output_video.mp4'` with the desired output file name and path.

That's it! You have successfully applied a 3D effect to the input video using Moviepy.

## Conclusion

Moviepy makes it easy to apply 3D effects to videos in Python. With just a few lines of code, you can create stunning visual effects. Experiment with different rotation angles and combine it with other effects to unleash your creativity. Enjoy editing your videos with Moviepy!
