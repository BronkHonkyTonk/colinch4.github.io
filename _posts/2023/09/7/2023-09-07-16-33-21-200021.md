![Image Metadata](https://example.com/myimage.jpg)

Image metadata contains additional information about an image, such as the camera make and model, date taken, and geolocation. In Python, we can use the **imageio** library to read and edit image metadata. In this tutorial, we will explore how to modify image metadata using **imageio**.

## Installing imageio

To begin, we need to install **imageio**. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```python
pip install imageio
```

## Reading Image Metadata

Once we have **imageio** installed, we can start reading image metadata. Here's an example of how to do it:

```python
import imageio

image_path = "path/to/image.jpg"
metadata = imageio.immeta.immeta(image_path)

print(metadata)
```

This code snippet reads the metadata of the specified image and stores it in the `metadata` variable. We can then print the metadata to see its contents.

## Modifying Image Metadata

To modify image metadata, we need to access and update specific metadata fields. Here's an example of how to modify the camera make and model metadata fields:

```python
import imageio

image_path = "path/to/image.jpg"
metadata = imageio.immeta.immeta(image_path)

metadata["CameraMake"] = "Canon"
metadata["CameraModel"] = "EOS 5D Mark IV"

imageio.immeta.immeta.update(image_path, metadata)

print("Metadata updated successfully!")
```

In this code, we first read the metadata of the image using `imageio.immeta.immeta()`. We then update the `CameraMake` and `CameraModel` fields in the `metadata` dictionary. Finally, we use `imageio.immeta.immeta.update()` to save the updated metadata back to the image file.

## Conclusion

With the help of the **imageio** library, we can easily read and modify image metadata in Python. This can be useful in various applications where we need to manage and edit image information. Experiment with different metadata fields and explore the possibilities of working with image metadata using **imageio**.

Remember, practicing is the best way to learn. So go ahead and try modifying metadata for your own images!

*Note: The `imageio` library supports a wide range of image formats, so you can use it with JPEG, PNG, GIF, and many other image types.*
