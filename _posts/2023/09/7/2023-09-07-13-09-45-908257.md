When using `subprocess.run()`, you can pass additional arguments to customize the behavior of the subprocess. One such argument is `text`, which allows you to specify whether the input and output of the subprocess should be treated as text.

By default, `text` is set to `False`, which means that the input and output are treated as bytes. However, you can change it to `True` to enable text mode. In text mode, the input and output of the subprocess are treated as strings.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the `text` argument in `subprocess.run()`:

```python
import subprocess

# Run a command and capture its output as text
result = subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'], text=True, capture_output=True)

# Print the output
print(result.stdout)
```

In the above example, we run the `ls -l` command using `subprocess.run()` with `text` set to `True`. This means that the output of the subprocess will be treated as text. The `capture_output` parameter is also set to `True` to capture the output in the `result` object.

We can then access the captured output through the `stdout` attribute of the `result` object and print it. Since `stdout` is treated as text, we can directly print it without decoding it from bytes.

Using the `text` mode in `subprocess` is helpful when you want to work with text-based processes and manipulate their output as strings. It simplifies the process of handling input and output, allowing you to focus on the logic of your program.
