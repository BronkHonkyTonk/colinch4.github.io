In Python, the `requests` library is widely used for sending HTTP requests and handling responses. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for making HTTP calls and is often used in web scraping, API consumption, and testing.

This blog post will focus on testing and mocking requests in Python, specifically using the `requests-mock` library. `requests-mock` allows you to effectively test code that interacts with external APIs by simulating HTTP requests and responses.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the `requests` and `requests-mock` libraries in your Python environment. You can use the following `pip` command to install both libraries:

```python
pip install requests requests-mock
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use `requests-mock` to mock requests in your tests:

```python
import requests
import requests_mock

with requests_mock.Mocker() as mocker:
    mocker.register_uri(
        'GET',
        'https://api.example.com/users',
        json={'users': [{'name': 'John'}, {'name': 'Jane'}]}
    )

    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/users')
    data = response.json()

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert data['users'][0]['name'] == 'John'
```

In the above example, we use `requests-mock` to mock a `GET` request to the specified URL (`https://api.example.com/users`). We define the response body as a JSON object with a list of users. We then make a request using `requests` as usual and verify that the response status code is 200 and the first user's name is "John".

## Advanced Usage

`requests-mock` provides more advanced features to mock different types of requests and responses, handle multiple endpoints, and dynamically generate responses. Here are a few examples:

### Mocking Different Types of Requests

```python
import requests
import requests_mock

with requests_mock.Mocker() as mocker:
    mocker.get('https://api.example.com/get', json={'response': 'GET'})
    mocker.post('https://api.example.com/post', json={'response': 'POST'})
    mocker.put('https://api.example.com/put', json={'response': 'PUT'})
    mocker.delete('https://api.example.com/delete', json={'response': 'DELETE'})

    get_response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/get')
    post_response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/post')
    put_response = requests.put('https://api.example.com/put')
    delete_response = requests.delete('https://api.example.com/delete')

    assert get_response.json()['response'] == 'GET'
    assert post_response.json()['response'] == 'POST'
    assert put_response.json()['response'] == 'PUT'
    assert delete_response.json()['response'] == 'DELETE'
```

In this example, we mock different types of requests (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) to different endpoints and verify that the responses match the expected values.

### Handling Multiple Endpoints

```python
import requests
import requests_mock

with requests_mock.Mocker() as mocker:
    mocker.get('https://api.example.com/users', json={'users': [{'name': 'John'}]})
    mocker.get('https://api.example.com/products', json={'products': [{'name': 'Keyboard'}]})

    users_response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/users')
    products_response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/products')

    assert users_response.json()['users'][0]['name'] == 'John'
    assert products_response.json()['products'][0]['name'] == 'Keyboard'
```

In this example, we mock requests to different endpoints (`/users` and `/products`) and verify that the responses contain the expected data.

### Dynamic Responses

```python
import requests
import requests_mock

def dynamic_response(request, context):
    if 'users' in request.url:
        context.status_code = 200
        context.json = {'users': [{'name': 'John'}]}
    elif 'products' in request.url:
        context.status_code = 200
        context.json = {'products': [{'name': 'Keyboard'}]}
    else:
        context.status_code = 404

with requests_mock.Mocker() as mocker:
    mocker.get('https://api.example.com', json=dynamic_response)

    users_response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/users')
    products_response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/products')
    unknown_response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/unknown')

    assert users_response.json()['users'][0]['name'] == 'John'
    assert products_response.json()['products'][0]['name'] == 'Keyboard'
    assert unknown_response.status_code == 404
```

In this example, we define a dynamic response function (`dynamic_response`) that examines the request URL and generates appropriate responses based on the URL path. We then register this function as the response for any request to `https://api.example.com`. We verify that the responses contain the expected data or return a `404` status code if the URL is unknown.

## Conclusion

Testing and mocking requests in Python is crucial when developing applications that rely on external APIs. The `requests-mock` library simplifies the process of mocking requests and responses, allowing you to effectively test your code. With the techniques discussed in this blog post, you can confidently test your code's behavior in a controlled environment without the need for real network requests. Happy testing!
