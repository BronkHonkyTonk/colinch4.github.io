The `subprocess` module in Python provides functionality for spawning new processes, connecting to their input/output/error pipes, and obtaining their return codes. One of the most commonly used functions in this module is `subprocess.run()`.

## What is subprocess.run()?

`subprocess.run()` is a high-level method that combines the functionality of `subprocess.Popen()` and `subprocess.communicate()` into a single convenient call. It allows you to execute a command in the shell and wait for it to complete, capturing its output and return code.

## Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use `subprocess.run()`:

```python
import subprocess

# Run a command and wait for it to complete
result = subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"], capture_output=True, text=True)

# Print the command's return code
print("Return code:", result.returncode)

# Print the command's output
print("Output:\n", result.stdout)
```

In this example, we are using `subprocess.run()` to run the `ls -l` command, which lists the contents of a directory in long format. The `capture_output=True` argument tells `subprocess.run()` to capture the command's output, and `text=True` specifies that the output should be decoded as a string.

We then access the command's return code using `result.returncode` and the output using `result.stdout`. You can also access the error output using `result.stderr`.

## Input and Output

By default, `subprocess.run()` does not capture the command's input. However, you can pass the input using the `input` parameter:

```python
import subprocess

# Run a command with input
result = subprocess.run(["grep", "apple"], capture_output=True, text=True, input="apple\nbanana\ncarrot\n")

# Print the command's output
print("Output:\n", result.stdout)
```

In this example, we are using `subprocess.run()` to run the `grep` command, which searches for the keyword "apple" in the input. We pass the input using the `input` parameter, which takes a string.

## Error Handling

When `subprocess.run()` encounters an error, it raises a `subprocess.CalledProcessError` exception. You can catch this exception to handle errors gracefully:

```python
import subprocess

try:
    # Run a command and handle errors
    subprocess.run(["nonexistent_command"], check=True)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print("Command failed with return code", e.returncode)
    print("Error output:", e.stderr)
```

In this example, we are attempting to run a nonexistent command, which will raise a `CalledProcessError`. We catch the exception and print the return code and error output.

## Conclusion

`subprocess.run()` is a powerful and convenient function in Python for executing shell commands and capturing their output. By understanding its basic usage and options, you can easily integrate shell commands into your Python programs.

Remember to **import** the `subprocess` module at the beginning of your script before using `subprocess.run()`.
