## Introduction

`catboost` is a state-of-the-art open-source gradient boosting library that is renowned for its ability to handle categorical variables without requiring extensive preprocessing. It offers excellent performance and supports various features such as numerical and categorical data handling, built-in cross-validation, and GPU acceleration.

In this blog post, we will walk through the installation process of `catboost` in Python. We will cover two methods: using `pip` and using `conda`. Let's get started!

## Installation using pip

1. Open your command prompt or terminal.
2. Ensure that you have the latest version of `pip` installed by running the following command:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```
3. To install `catboost`, execute the following command:
```bash
pip install catboost
```
4. Wait for the installation to complete. Once done, you can now use `catboost` in your Python environment.

## Installation using conda

1. Open your command prompt or terminal.
2. If you haven't already, install `conda` by following the instructions on the official Anaconda website: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
3. After installing `conda`, create a new virtual environment by running the following command:
