In this blog post, we will explore how to adjust the playback speed of audio using the **pydub** library in Python. Whether you want to speed up a podcast or slow down a song, pydub provides a simple and efficient way to modify audio speeds.

## Installing pydub

To get started, make sure you have the pydub library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using **pip**:

```
pip install pydub
```

## Loading and Adjusting Audio Speed

Once you have pydub installed, you can load an audio file and adjust its speed using the `AudioSegment` and `speedup`/`slowdown` methods. Here's an example:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load the audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("input.mp3", format="mp3")

# Adjust the speed by scaling it up (2x faster)
audio = audio.speedup(playback_speed=2.0)

# Save the modified audio to a new file
audio.export("output.mp3", format="mp3")
```

In this example, we load an audio file called "input.mp3" and use the `speedup` method to double the playback speed. The modified audio is then exported to a new file called "output.mp3".

You can also slow down the audio by using the `slowdown` method:

```python
audio = audio.slowdown(playback_speed=0.5)
```

In this case, the `slowdown` method slows down the audio to half of its original speed.

## Adjusting Speed with a Percentage

If you prefer to adjust the audio speed by a percentage, you can use the `speedup`/`slowdown` methods and provide the percentage value as a parameter. Here's an example:

```python
audio = audio.speedup(playback_speed=1.5, chunk_size=150, crossfade=25)
```

In this example, we increase the speed of the audio by 50% (1.5x faster). The `chunk_size` parameter determines the size of each audio chunk that is processed, and the `crossfade` parameter controls the length of crossfades applied to the chunks. Adjust these parameters according to your specific needs.

## Conclusion

Adjusting the speed of audio files using pydub is a straightforward process. In this blog post, we learned how to install pydub, load audio files, and modify their playback speed using the `speedup` and `slowdown` methods. Whether you want to speed up or slow down your audio, pydub provides a convenient solution.

Give it a try and enhance your audio playback experience!
