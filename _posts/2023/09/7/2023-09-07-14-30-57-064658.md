When working with audio files in Python, one of the impressive libraries is pydub. **pydub** provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for manipulating and working with audio files. In addition to basic audio file manipulation tasks such as slicing, concatenating, and exporting, pydub also allows you to extract various information from audio files.

In this blog post, we will focus on extracting information from audio files using pydub.

## Installation

Before we begin, ensure that you have pydub installed. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install pydub
```

## Extracting Audio File Information

To extract audio file information, we can use the `AudioSegment` class provided by pydub. Let's see how we can extract the information such as duration, sample rate, and channels from an audio file:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load the audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("sample_audio.wav")

# Extract the duration in milliseconds
duration = len(audio)

# Extract the sample rate
sample_rate = audio.frame_rate

# Extract the number of channels
channels = audio.channels

# Print the extracted information
print("Duration:", duration, "ms")
print("Sample rate:", sample_rate, "Hz")
print("Channels:", channels)
```

In the above code snippet, we first import the `AudioSegment` class from `pydub`. We then load the audio file using the `from_file` method of `AudioSegment`, passing the file name as the argument.

Next, we extract the duration of the audio using the `len` function, which gives us the length of the audio in milliseconds. We extract the sample rate of the audio using the `frame_rate` attribute, and the number of channels using the `channels` attribute.

Finally, we print the extracted information to the console.

## Conclusion

Using pydub, we can easily extract various information from audio files in Python. In this blog post, we explored the extraction of duration, sample rate, and channels from an audio file. pydub provides a wide range of functionalities and is an excellent library for working with audio files in Python.

Give it a try and start exploring the world of audio manipulation with pydub!

**Note: Remember to close the audio file after you are done using it to avoid possible resource leaks.**

The examples provided in this blog post assume that you have a `sample_audio.wav` file in the same directory as your Python script. Modify the file name accordingly to match the audio file you are working with.

Please refer to the official pydub documentation for more details and advanced usage scenarios.
