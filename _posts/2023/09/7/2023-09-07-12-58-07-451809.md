In Python, the `subprocess` module provides a way to create new processes, interact with them, and retrieve their output. One useful function in this module is `subprocess.check_output()`, which allows you to capture the output of a command executed in a subprocess.

## The `check_output()` Function

The `check_output()` function is a convenience method to run a command and capture its standard output as a byte string. It takes a single argument, which is the command to be executed, and returns the output as a byte string.

```python
import subprocess

output = subprocess.check_output(["ls", "-l"])
print(output)
```

In the code above, `subprocess.check_output(["ls", "-l"])` executes the `ls -l` command in a subprocess and captures its output. The output is then printed using the `print()` function.

## Capturing Output as a String

By default, `check_output()` returns the output as a byte string. If you want to capture the output as a regular string, you can specify the `encoding` parameter.

```python
import subprocess

output = subprocess.check_output(["ls", "-l"], encoding="utf-8")
print(output)
```

In this example, `output` will be a string representing the output of the `ls -l` command.

## Handling Command Execution Errors

If the command executed by `check_output()` returns a non-zero exit status, a `CalledProcessError` exception is raised. You can catch this exception and handle the error accordingly.

```python
import subprocess

try:
    output = subprocess.check_output(["invalid_command"])
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Command execution failed with return code {e.returncode}.")
```

In this case, the `invalid_command` will raise a `CalledProcessError`, and the error message will be printed.

## Conclusion

The `subprocess.check_output()` function provides a convenient way to execute commands in a subprocess and capture their output. It is a powerful tool for running external commands from within your Python scripts and automating various tasks.
