To set a custom `sys.ps2`, you need to import the `sys` module and modify the `ps2` attribute. Here's an example:

```python
import sys

sys.ps2 = ">>> "

print("Enter a multi-line code block:")
code_block = ""
line = input(sys.ps2)
while line:
    code_block += line + "\n"
    line = input(sys.ps2)

print("Executing code block:")
exec(code_block)
```

In this example, we first import the `sys` module. Then we set `sys.ps2` to the desired prompt, which in this case is `">>> "`. 

Next, we ask the user to enter a multi-line code block. We initialize an empty string `code_block` to store the complete code. We then use a loop to continuously read lines of input until the user enters an empty line. Each line is appended to `code_block` along with a newline character.

Once the user finishes entering the code block, we print a message indicating that the code block is being executed. We use the `exec()` function to execute the code stored in `code_block`.

By customizing `sys.ps2`, you can make the prompt more visually appealing or provide additional information to guide the user when entering multi-line code blocks.
