![Image Rotation](https://example.com/image_rotation.png)

Image rotation is a common image processing task that involves rotating an image by a certain angle around its center. In Python, the `imageio` library provides a simple and convenient way to read, write, and manipulate images. In this blog post, we will explore how to rotate an image using `imageio` in Python.

## Installing ImageIO

To begin, you need to install `imageio` library. You can install it using pip by running the following command:

```python
pip install imageio
```

## Rotating an Image

Once you have installed `imageio`, you can start rotating images. Let's go through a simple example to rotate an image by 90 degrees clockwise.

```python
import imageio
import numpy as np

# Load the image
image = imageio.imread('path/to/image.jpg')

# Rotate the image by 90 degrees clockwise
rotated_image = np.rot90(image, k=1)

# Save the rotated image
imageio.imsave('path/to/rotated_image.jpg', rotated_image)
```

In the code above, we first load the image using `imageio.imread()` function. Next, we use `np.rot90()` function from NumPy library to rotate the image by 90 degrees clockwise. Finally, we save the rotated image using `imageio.imsave()` function.

You can experiment with different rotation angles by changing the `k` parameter in the `np.rot90()` function. For example, if you want to rotate the image by 180 degrees, set `k=2`.

## Conclusion

Image rotation is a useful technique in image processing that allows you to manipulate the orientation of an image. With `imageio` library in Python, you can easily rotate images by any desired angle. Whether you want to correct the alignment of an image or apply artistic effects, image rotation can be a powerful tool. Give it a try and see how it can enhance your image processing workflows.
