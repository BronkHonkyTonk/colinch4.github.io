Mongoengine is an Object-Document Mapper (ODM) library for MongoDB and provides an easy and convenient way to interact with MongoDB databases using Python. One common requirement when working with large datasets is to implement paging or pagination, which allows retrieving data in smaller chunks or pages.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement pagination using Mongoengine in Python.

## Step 1: Install mongoengine

Before we begin, make sure you have mongoengine installed. You can install it using `pip`:

```
pip install mongoengine
```

## Step 2: Set up the database connection

To start using mongoengine, we need to connect to a MongoDB database. Here's an example of how to set up a connection to a local MongoDB instance:

```python
from mongoengine import connect

connect('mydatabase', host='localhost', port=27017)
```

Replace `mydatabase` with the name of your database.

## Step 3: Define a mongoengine document

Next, we need to define a mongoengine document, which represents a collection in MongoDB. Here's an example of a simple document representing a `User`:

```python
from mongoengine import Document, StringField

class User(Document):
    name = StringField()
    email = StringField()
```

## Step 4: Implement pagination

To implement pagination, we will use the `skip()` and `limit()` methods provided by mongoengine. The `skip()` method is used to skip a certain number of documents, and the `limit()` method is used to limit the number of documents returned.

Here's an example of how to implement pagination using mongoengine:

```python
page_size = 10  # Number of documents per page
page_number = 1  # Current page number

users = User.objects.skip((page_number - 1) * page_size).limit(page_size)

for user in users:
    print(user.name)
```

In the above example, `skip()` is used to skip `(page_number - 1) * page_size` documents and `limit()` is used to limit the result to `page_size` documents.

## Step 5: Handling total number of documents

Sometimes, you might want to retrieve the total number of documents for displaying purposes or calculating the total number of pages. You can achieve this using the `count()` method provided by mongoengine:

```python
total_count = User.objects.count()
total_pages = (total_count // page_size) + (1 if total_count % page_size > 0 else 0)

print(f"Total users: {total_count}")
print(f"Total pages: {total_pages}")
```

In the above example, `count()` is used to retrieve the total number of documents. We then calculate the total number of pages by dividing the total count by the page size and adding an additional page if there are remaining documents.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to implement pagination using mongoengine in Python. By using the `skip()` and `limit()` methods provided by mongoengine, we can easily retrieve data in smaller chunks or pages. Additionally, we have learned how to handle the total number of documents for displaying purposes.

Paging is a crucial feature when working with large datasets, as it helps improve performance and provides a better user experience. With mongoengine, implementing pagination becomes straightforward and efficient.
