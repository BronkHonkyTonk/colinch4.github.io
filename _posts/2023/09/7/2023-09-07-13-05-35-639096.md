The `dlopen()` system call is commonly used to load dynamic libraries or shared objects at runtime. These libraries provide additional functionality that can be used by the program during execution. The `getdlopenflags()` function allows you to retrieve the current flags used by the dynamic linker.

To use the `getdlopenflags()` function in Python, you first need to import the `sys` module:

```python
import sys
```

Once the `sys` module is imported, you can invoke the `getdlopenflags()` function:

```python
flags = sys.getdlopenflags()
```

The `flags` variable will now hold the current dlopen flags. This value can be used to determine how the dynamic linker behaves when opening shared libraries. The possible flags include `RTLD_LAZY`, `RTLD_NOW`, `RTLD_GLOBAL`, and `RTLD_LOCAL`, among others.

The `getdlopenflags()` function is useful when you want to obtain information about the flags currently used by the dynamic linker. For example, you can check if the `RTLD_GLOBAL` flag is set, which means that the loaded libraries will be available for symbol resolution to other shared libraries loaded later. This can be important when dealing with shared objects and their dependencies.

In conclusion, the `sys.getdlopenflags()` function in Python provides a convenient way to retrieve the dlopen flags used by the dynamic linker. This information can be useful for understanding how shared libraries are loaded and resolving symbol dependencies in your Python programs.
