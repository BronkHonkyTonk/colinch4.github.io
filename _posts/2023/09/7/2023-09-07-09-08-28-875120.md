Bokeh is a powerful data visualization library in Python that allows you to create interactive plots and charts. In this blog post, we will explore how to create basic graphs using Bokeh.

## Installation

Before we get started, make sure you have Bokeh installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install bokeh
```

Once installed, you are ready to create your first Bokeh graph!

## Basic Graph with Bokeh

To create a basic graph with Bokeh, we need to import the necessary modules and data, create a figure object, and then plot the data on the figure.

Let's start by importing the required modules and generating some sample data:

```python
import numpy as np
from bokeh.plotting import figure, show

# Generate some sample data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)
```

Next, we need to create a figure object. The `figure()` function is used to define the properties of the graph such as the size, title, axes labels, etc.

```python
# Create a figure object
p = figure(title="Basic Bokeh Graph", x_axis_label='X', y_axis_label='Y')
```

Now, we can plot our data on the figure. The `line()` method is used to draw a line plot. We pass in the x and y coordinates as arguments.

```python
# Plot the data
p.line(x, y, line_width=2)
```

Finally, we can display the graph using the `show()` function.

```python
# Display the graph
show(p)
```

And there you have it! A basic graph created using Bokeh. You can customize various aspects of the graph such as the line color, line width, and plot markers. Bokeh provides a wide range of options to make your graphs more visually appealing and interactive.

## Conclusion

Bokeh is a great library for creating interactive data visualizations in Python. In this blog post, we learned how to create a basic graph using Bokeh. With Bokeh, you can create stunning visualizations for your data and explore it in a more interactive way.
