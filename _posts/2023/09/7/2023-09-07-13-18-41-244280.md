In certain scenarios, we may need to adjust the priority of a process to optimize system resources. In the context of Python, `subprocess` is a powerful module that allows us to execute system commands and manage processes. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of setting the **Normal Priority Class** for a process using the `subprocess` module in Python.

## What is Priority Class?

In operating systems, each process is assigned a priority class that determines the amount of CPU time it receives. The priority class is a metric used to assign importance to processes, allowing the operating system to allocate system resources efficiently. The priority range can differ between operating systems, but generally, a lower value indicates a higher priority.

## The `subprocess` Module

The `subprocess` module in Python provides a way to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. It allows us to execute system commands, scripts, and applications from within our Python programs.

## Adjusting Priority Class with `subprocess`

To adjust the priority class of a process, we can utilize the parameter `creationflags` and the `subprocess.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` constant available in the `subprocess` module. Additionally, we can set the normal priority using the `subprocess.NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS` constant.

Below is an example that demonstrates the process of setting the normal priority class in Python using `subprocess`:

```python
import subprocess

def set_normal_priority(command):
    process = subprocess.Popen(command, creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP | subprocess.NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS)
    process.wait()

# Example usage
set_normal_priority(['python', 'my_script.py'])
```

In the example above, the `subprocess.Popen` function is used to spawn a new process with the specified command. The `creationflags` argument is used to set additional flags for the process creation, including the priority class.

By combining the `subprocess.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` and `subprocess.NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS` constants within the `creationflags` argument, we can ensure that the spawned process has a normal priority class.

Finally, the `process.wait()` function is called to wait for the process to finish execution. This is necessary to prevent the parent process from terminating before the child process completes.

## Summary

Adjusting the priority class of a process can be beneficial in scenarios where it is necessary to allocate system resources efficiently. The `subprocess` module in Python provides the necessary functionality to set the priority class of a spawned process.

In this blog post, we have explored the concept of setting the normal priority class using the `subprocess` module. We have provided an example demonstrating how to utilize the `creationflags` argument and the `subprocess.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` and `subprocess.NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS` constants to achieve this.

By understanding and utilizing the capabilities of the `subprocess` module, we can gain better control over our processes and optimize the utilization of system resources.
