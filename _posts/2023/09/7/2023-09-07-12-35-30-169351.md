To obtain the current working directory in Python, you can simply call the `os.getcwd()` function. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
import os

# Get the current working directory
current_directory = os.getcwd()

# Print the current working directory
print("Current working directory:", current_directory)
```

In the above code, we first import the `os` module. Then, we use the `os.getcwd()` function to retrieve the current working directory and store it in the `current_directory` variable. Finally, we print the current working directory using the `print()` function.

When you execute the code, you will see the current working directory printed on the terminal or console.

Using the `os.getcwd()` function can be useful in various scenarios, especially when you need to work with files or directories in a specific location relative to the current working directory.
