Python provides a powerful feature called **coroutines** that allow for cooperative multitasking and asynchronous programming. Coroutines are functions that can be paused and resumed at specific points without blocking the execution of other code.

In Python, we can create coroutines using the `async` and `await` keywords. However, in some cases, we may want to customize how coroutines are scheduled and executed. This is where `sys.get_coroutine_wrapper()` comes into play.

## What is `sys.get_coroutine_wrapper()`?

In Python's `sys` module, the `get_coroutine_wrapper()` function returns the currently installed coroutine wrapper. A coroutine wrapper is a callable object that wraps coroutines and applies additional behavior or modifications during their execution.

The `get_coroutine_wrapper()` function allows us to access and modify the behavior of the coroutine wrapper, providing more flexibility and control over how coroutines are executed.

## Usage Examples

Let's explore some examples to better understand how `sys.get_coroutine_wrapper()` can be used.

### Example 1: Default Coroutine Wrapper

By default, Python uses a built-in coroutine wrapper called `asyncio.Task`. We can retrieve the currently installed coroutine wrapper using `sys.get_coroutine_wrapper()`.

```python
import sys

coroutine_wrapper = sys.get_coroutine_wrapper()
print(coroutine_wrapper)  # Output: <class 'asyncio.tasks.Task'>
```

In this example, `coroutine_wrapper` will hold a reference to the default coroutine wrapper class, which is `asyncio.tasks.Task`.

### Example 2: Customizing the Coroutine Wrapper

We can also customize the coroutine wrapper by assigning a custom wrapper class using `sys.set_coroutine_wrapper()`.

```python
import sys
import asyncio

class CustomCoroutineWrapper:
    def __init__(self, coroutine):
        self.coroutine = coroutine

    def __call__(self):
        # Add custom behavior here
        return self.coroutine()

sys.set_coroutine_wrapper(CustomCoroutineWrapper)

coroutine_wrapper = sys.get_coroutine_wrapper()
print(coroutine_wrapper)  # Output: <class '__main__.CustomCoroutineWrapper'>
```

In this example, we defined our own `CustomCoroutineWrapper` class, which takes the original coroutine as an argument and adds custom behavior before executing it. We assigned this custom wrapper using `sys.set_coroutine_wrapper()`, and `coroutine_wrapper` now holds a reference to our custom wrapper class.

## Summary

`sys.get_coroutine_wrapper()` is a useful function in Python's `sys` module that allows us to access and modify the currently installed coroutine wrapper. By customizing the coroutine wrapper, we can add additional behavior or modify the execution of coroutines to suit our specific needs in cooperative multitasking and asynchronous programming.
