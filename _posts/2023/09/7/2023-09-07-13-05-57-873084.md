To use `subprocess.cwd()`, you need to import the `subprocess` module first. Here's an example:

```python
import subprocess

current_directory = subprocess.cwd()
print("Current working directory:", current_directory)
```

In the example above, we import the `subprocess` module and then call the `subprocess.cwd()` function to get the current working directory. We store the result in the `current_directory` variable and then print it out using the `print()` function.

When you run this code, it will display the current working directory on your console like this:

```
Current working directory: /path/to/your/current/directory
```

It's worth noting that `subprocess.cwd()` returns a string representing the current working directory. This can be useful when you need to perform operations or access files relative to the current directory.

Using the `subprocess.cwd()` function is a convenient way to ensure that your Python script or application is executing in the correct working directory.
