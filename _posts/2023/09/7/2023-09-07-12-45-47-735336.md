To use `os.getpid()`, you need to import the `os` module in Python:

```python
import os

# Get the process ID
pid = os.getpid()

print("Process ID:", pid)
```

When you run the above code, it will display the process ID of your Python program.

It's important to note that the PID is specific to the current process. Therefore, every time you run your program, a different PID will be assigned. 

Additionally, the `os` module provides other functions and attributes related to process management, such as `os.getppid()` to get the parent process ID, `os.kill(pid, signal)` to send a signal to a process, and `os.fork()` to create a child process, among others.

Knowing how to retrieve the PID is beneficial in scenarios where you need to monitor the behavior of your program or manage multiple processes simultaneously. You can leverage the PID to perform system-level operations, such as sending signals or interacting with other processes.

In conclusion, the `os.getpid()` function in Python allows you to retrieve the process ID of your program, which can be helpful in various system administration and debugging tasks.
