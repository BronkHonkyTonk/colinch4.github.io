Image noise refers to random variations in brightness or color that can distort the visual quality of an image. It is often a result of various factors such as sensor limitations, compression artifacts, or environmental conditions during image capture. Removing or adding noise to an image is a common task in image processing and computer vision.

In Python, **imageio** is a powerful library that provides various functionalities for working with images. It supports reading and writing a wide range of image formats and offers useful tools for manipulating images, including noise addition and removal.

## Adding Noise to an Image
To add noise to an image using **imageio**, you can utilize the **random_noise()** function from the **skimage** module. This function can generate different types of noise patterns, including Gaussian, Poisson, Salt-and-pepper, and Speckle noise.

Here's an example of adding Gaussian noise to an image:

```python
import imageio
from skimage.util import random_noise

# Read the image
image = imageio.imread('image.jpg')

# Add Gaussian noise to the image
noisy_image = random_noise(image, mode='gaussian')

# Save the noisy image
imageio.imwrite('noisy_image.jpg', noisy_image)
```

## Removing Noise from an Image
Removing noise from an image helps enhance its quality and improve visual perception. Python's **imageio** library offers several methods to denoise an image, such as the **denoise_tv_chambolle()** function from the **skimage** module. This technique uses the Total Variation (TV) denoising algorithm.

Here's an example of denoising an image using the Chambolle method:

```python
import imageio
from skimage.restoration import denoise_tv_chambolle

# Read the noisy image
noisy_image = imageio.imread('noisy_image.jpg')

# Apply Chambolle denoising algorithm to the image
denoised_image = denoise_tv_chambolle(noisy_image, weight=0.1)

# Save the denoised image
imageio.imwrite('denoised_image.jpg', denoised_image)
```

## Conclusion
Using the **imageio** library in Python, you can easily add or remove noise from images. Whether you want to simulate noisy environments or enhance the quality of your images, **imageio** provides a convenient and efficient way to handle various image processing tasks.
