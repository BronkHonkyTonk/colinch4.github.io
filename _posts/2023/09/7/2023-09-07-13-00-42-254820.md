When working with subprocesses in Python, it's important to be able to retrieve the status code of a process after it has completed. The `subprocess` module provides a handy function called `getstatus()` that can be used for this purpose. However, please note that this function is **deprecated** since Python 3.5 and has been replaced by the `subprocess.run()` function.

## Why is `subprocess.getstatus()` deprecated?

The `getstatus()` function was deprecated in favor of the more versatile and comprehensive `subprocess.run()` function, which was introduced in Python 3.5. The `run()` function provides a simplified interface for running subprocesses and captures the process' return code automatically.

## How to use `subprocess.getstatus()`?

To use `subprocess.getstatus()`, you first need to import the `subprocess` module in your Python script:

```python
import subprocess
```

Then, you can use the `getstatus()` function to run a command and get the status code:

```python
status, output = subprocess.getstatusoutput("<your command>")
```

Here, `status` will contain the return code of the command, and `output` will contain the captured output of the command.

## Example usage

Let's say we want to run a simple command like `ls -l` and get its status code using the `getstatus()` function:

```python
import subprocess

status, output = subprocess.getstatusoutput("ls -l")

if status == 0:
    print("Command executed successfully!")
else:
    print("Command failed with status code:", status)
```

In the example above, if the `ls -l` command is executed successfully, the script will print "Command executed successfully!". Otherwise, it will print "Command failed with status code:" along with the actual status code.

## Conclusion

Although `subprocess.getstatus()` is a convenient function for getting the status code of a process, it has been deprecated since Python 3.5 in favor of the more powerful `subprocess.run()` function. It is recommended to update your code to use the new function to ensure compatibility and take advantage of the enhanced features it provides.
