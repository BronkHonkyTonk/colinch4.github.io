To use `os.path.abspath()`, you need to import the `os` module first. Here's an example:

```python
import os

relative_path = "my_folder/my_file.txt"
absolute_path = os.path.abspath(relative_path)

print(f"Relative path: {relative_path}")
print(f"Absolute path: {absolute_path}")
```

Output:
```
Relative path: my_folder/my_file.txt
Absolute path: /home/user/my_folder/my_file.txt
```

In the example above, we start by defining a relative path (`my_folder/my_file.txt`). This is a path that is relative to the current working directory. 

We then pass this relative path to `os.path.abspath()` and assign the return value to the variable `absolute_path`. The `os.path.abspath()` function converts the relative path to an absolute path based on the current working directory.

Finally, we print both the relative and absolute paths using the `print()` function.

The output shows that the relative path `my_folder/my_file.txt` is converted to the absolute path `/home/user/my_folder/my_file.txt`. The absolute path represents the full path from the root directory to the specified file or directory.

Using `os.path.abspath()` can be beneficial when you want to convert a relative path to an absolute path, especially when dealing with files, directories, or file operations in your Python programs.
