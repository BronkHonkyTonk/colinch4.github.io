In Python, the `os` module provides various functions for interacting with the operating system. One commonly used function is `os.rename()`, which allows you to rename a file using Python code.

### Syntax

The syntax of `os.rename()` is as follows:

```python
os.rename(src, dst)
```

Here, `src` is the current name of the file or directory, and `dst` is the new name that you want to assign to the file or directory.

### Example

Let's consider a simple example where we want to rename a file named "old_name.txt" to "new_name.txt".

```python
import os

old_name = "old_name.txt"
new_name = "new_name.txt"

os.rename(old_name, new_name)
```

In the code snippet above, we first import the `os` module. Then, we define the old and new names of the file we want to rename. Finally, we call `os.rename()` with the old and new names as arguments to rename the file.

### Error Handling

It's important to note that the `os.rename()` function can raise an exception if there are any errors during the renaming process. Some common exceptions include `FileNotFoundError` if the source file doesn't exist or `PermissionError` if the code doesn't have the required permissions to rename the file.

To handle exceptions, you can use a try-except block:

```python
import os

old_name = "old_name.txt"
new_name = "new_name.txt"

try:
    os.rename(old_name, new_name)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
except PermissionError:
    print("Permission denied!")
```

In the example above, we catch the `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError` exceptions separately and print an appropriate error message.

### Conclusion

Using the `os.rename()` function in Python, you can easily rename files or directories programmatically. It's a powerful feature that can come in handy when dealing with file management tasks in your Python applications. Make sure to handle exceptions appropriately to handle any potential errors that may occur during the renaming process.
