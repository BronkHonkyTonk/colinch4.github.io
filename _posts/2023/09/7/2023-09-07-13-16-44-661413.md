When running a program or a process on your computer, the operating system assigns a priority level to it. This priority level determines how much CPU time and system resources the process receives. In some cases, you may want to give your program a higher priority to ensure it runs smoothly and efficiently, even when other processes are running simultaneously.

In Python, you can make use of the `subprocess` module to launch processes and manage their execution. The `subprocess` module provides a class called `Popen` that allows you to create and control subprocesses. One of the attributes of this class is `priority`, which can be used to set the priority level of the subprocess.

One particular priority level that is often useful is the `ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS`. This priority class boosts the priority of the subprocess above the normal priority level, allowing it to get more CPU time and resources. 

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to set the priority of a subprocess to `ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS` in Python:

```python
import subprocess

# Command to be executed as a subprocess
command = ['python', 'script.py']

# Create the subprocess with elevated priority
subproc = subprocess.Popen(command, creationflags=subprocess.ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS)

# Wait for the subprocess to complete
subproc.wait()
```

In the above code, we create a subprocess using the `Popen` class. We pass the `command` to be executed as a list of strings. The `creationflags` parameter is set to `subprocess.ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS` to set the priority of the subprocess to `ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS`.

Finally, we wait for the subprocess to complete using the `wait` method of the `Popen` instance.

By setting the priority level of a subprocess to `ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS`, you can ensure that it receives sufficient resources and runs smoothly even in high-load situations.

**Note:** Setting the priority class of a process to a higher value may impact the overall performance of the system, as it gives the process more resources at the expense of other processes. Use this feature judiciously and consider the implications on system performance.
