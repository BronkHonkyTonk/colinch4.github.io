In this blog post, we will discuss how to create a separate WOW VDM (Virtual DOS Machine) using the `subprocess` module in Python. The WOW VDM allows you to run 16-bit-based applications on a 64-bit operating system.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website.

## Using the subprocess module

The `subprocess` module in Python provides the functionality to create and manage subprocesses. It allows you to spawn new processes, communicate with them, and retrieve their return codes.

To create a separate WOW VDM, we can use the `subprocess.CREATE_SEPARATE_WOW_VDM` flag. This flag ensures that the created subprocess runs in its own WOW VDM.

Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import subprocess

# Command to run in separate WOW VDM
command = 'my_16bit_application.exe'

# Create subprocess with CREATE_SEPARATE_WOW_VDM flag
subprocess.run(command, creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_SEPARATE_WOW_VDM)
```

In the above code, we import the `subprocess` module and define the command we want to run in the separate WOW VDM. In this example, we assume that `my_16bit_application.exe` is a 16-bit application.

Then, we use the `subprocess.run()` function to create a subprocess. We pass the command and the `creationflags` parameter with `subprocess.CREATE_SEPARATE_WOW_VDM` to specify the separate WOW VDM creation.

## Conclusion

Creating a separate WOW VDM using the `subprocess` module in Python allows you to run 16-bit applications on a 64-bit operating system. This can be useful when working with legacy software or when you need to run older applications that are not compatible with modern operating systems.

The `subprocess.CREATE_SEPARATE_WOW_VDM` flag enables the creation of a separate WOW VDM for the subprocess, ensuring it runs independently. By utilizing this functionality, you can seamlessly run your 16-bit applications in a modern environment.

I hope this blog post was helpful in understanding how to create a separate WOW VDM using the `subprocess` module in Python. Thank you for reading!
