MoviePy is a Python library for video editing and manipulation. It provides an easy-to-use interface to perform various operations on video files, such as cutting, merging, resizing, and adding effects.

This blog post will focus on the basic usage of MoviePy's `VideoFileClip` class, which allows us to work with video files. We will cover how to create a `VideoFileClip` object, access and modify video properties, and save the edited video to a file.

## Installation

First, make sure you have MoviePy installed on your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install moviepy
```

## Creating a VideoFileClip object

To get started, import the `VideoFileClip` class from the `moviepy.editor` module:

```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip
```

Now, let's create a `VideoFileClip` object by passing the path to a video file as a parameter:

```python
video = VideoFileClip("path/to/video.mp4")
```

Replace "path/to/video.mp4" with the actual path to your video file.

## Accessing and modifying video properties

Once the `VideoFileClip` object is created, we can access various properties of the video, such as duration, size, and framerate.

```python
duration = video.duration  # Get the duration of the video in seconds
size = video.size  # Get the size (width, height) of the video in pixels
fps = video.fps  # Get the frame rate of the video

print(f"Duration: {duration} seconds")
print(f"Size: {size[0]}x{size[1]} pixels")
print(f"Frame rate: {fps} fps")
```

We can also modify these properties if needed. For example, to resize the video to a specific width and height:

```python
video_resized = video.resize((1280, 720))  # Resize the video to 1280x720 pixels
```

## Saving the edited video

Finally, we can save the edited video to a file using the `write_videofile` method. Specify the output file path and format as parameters:

```python
output_path = "path/to/output.mp4"
video_resized.write_videofile(output_path)
```

Replace "path/to/output.mp4" with the desired output file path.

## Conclusion

MoviePy's `VideoFileClip` class provides a convenient way to work with video files in Python. In this blog post, we covered the basic usage of creating a `VideoFileClip` object, accessing and modifying video properties, and saving the edited video to a file.
