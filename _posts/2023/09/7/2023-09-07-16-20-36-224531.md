When debugging a Python program, it is often helpful to execute the code line by line to understand its behavior and track down any errors. The `pdb` module in Python provides a powerful debugger that allows you to do just that.

One of the most commonly used commands in `pdb` is `next` or `n`. This command allows you to execute the current line of code in your program and move to the next line.

To use the `next` command in `pdb`, follow these steps:

1. Import the `pdb` module in your Python script:

```python
import pdb
```

2. Set a breakpoint in your code at the line where you want the debugger to start:

```python
pdb.set_trace()
```

3. Run your program.

4. Once the debugger is triggered and you are in the interactive mode, type `n` or `next` and press enter to execute the current line of code and move to the next line.

Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of `next` command in `pdb`:

```python
import pdb

def greet(name):
    pdb.set_trace()
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

def main():
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    greet(name)
    print("Program execution completed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Let's say we want to debug the `greet` function. We set a breakpoint using `pdb.set_trace()` at the start of the `greet` function. When we run the program, it will stop at that line.

Once the debugger is triggered, we can use the `n` or `next` command to execute each line of code step by step. 

For example, if we type `n` and press enter, it will execute `print(f"Hello, {name}!")` and move to the next line, which in this case is the next line after the function call in the `main` function.

Using the `next` command allows us to inspect the values of variables, check the flow of control, and analyze code behavior line by line, making it an invaluable tool for debugging Python programs.

Remember to remove all `pdb` related code (including the `import pdb` line and the `pdb.set_trace()` line) once you have finished debugging your program.

Happy debugging!
