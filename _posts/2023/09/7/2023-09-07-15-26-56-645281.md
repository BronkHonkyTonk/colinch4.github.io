In this blog post, we will explore how to correct camera distortion using the `Pillow` library in Python. Camera distortion is a common problem in photography where straight lines appear curved due to the lens used or the angle of view. With the help of `Pillow`, we can easily correct this distortion and obtain corrected images.

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have `Pillow` installed in your Python environment. You can install it using `pip` by running the following command:

```
pip install pillow
```

Once `Pillow` is installed, we are ready to proceed.

## Correcting Camera Distortion

To correct camera distortion using `Pillow`, we will use the `lensfunpy` library, which provides a database of lens calibration data for various camera models and lenses. Follow these steps to correct camera distortion:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from PIL import Image
import lensfunpy
```

2. Load the image:

```python
image = Image.open("path/to/image.jpg")
```

3. Create a `lensfunpy` database:

```python
db = lensfunpy.Database()
```
 
4. Get the lens profile for your specific camera and lens combination:

```python
camera_maker = "Nikon"
camera_model = "D850"
lens_maker = "Nikon"
lens_model = "24-70mm f/2.8"
 
camera = db.find_camera(camera_maker, camera_model)
lens = db.find_lens(camera, lens_maker, lens_model)
```

5. Apply the correction to the image:

```python
corrected_image = lensfunpy.correct_image(image, camera, lens)
```

6. Save the corrected image:

```python
corrected_image.save("path/to/corrected_image.jpg")
```

And that's it! You have successfully corrected camera distortion using `Pillow` and `lensfunpy`.

## Conclusion

Camera distortion can significantly affect the quality of your photographs. Thankfully, with the help of libraries like `Pillow` and `lensfunpy`, correcting camera distortion has become easier than ever before. Now you can produce distortion-free, visually pleasing images.
