In MongoDB, the concept of embedded documents allows you to nest one document within another. This is useful when you have a document that contains a set of related data that you don't want to store separately.

MongoEngine, a Python Object-Document Mapper (ODM), provides support for working with embedded documents. With MongoEngine, you can define **EmbeddedDocument** classes that can be used to organize and structure your data within MongoDB.

## Defining an EmbeddedDocument

To define an embedded document with MongoEngine, you need to create a class that subclasses `mongoengine.EmbeddedDocument`. Below is an example of how to create an embedded document class representing a user's address:

```python
import mongoengine

class Address(mongoengine.EmbeddedDocument):
    street = mongoengine.StringField()
    city = mongoengine.StringField()
    state = mongoengine.StringField()
    zip_code = mongoengine.StringField()
```

In this example, the `Address` class is defined as an embedded document by subclassing `mongoengine.EmbeddedDocument`. The class has fields such as `street`, `city`, `state`, and `zip_code` which represent different properties of an address.

## Using Embedded Documents

Once you have defined an embedded document, you can use it within another document by declaring it as a field with the `EmbeddedDocumentField` type. In the example below, we define a `User` document that has an embedded `Address`:

```python
import mongoengine

class User(mongoengine.Document):
    name = mongoengine.StringField()
    address = mongoengine.EmbeddedDocumentField(Address)
```

The `User` class defines a `name` field of type `StringField` and an `address` field of type `EmbeddedDocumentField` that references the `Address` embedded document.

## Accessing Embedded Document Fields

To access the fields of an embedded document, you can use dot notation on the field within the parent document. In the example below, we create a `User` instance and access its embedded `Address` fields:

```python
user = User()
user.name = "John Doe"
user.address = Address(street="123 Main St", city="New York", state="NY", zip_code="10001")

print(user.name)
print(user.address.street)
print(user.address.city)
print(user.address.state)
print(user.address.zip_code)
```

In this example, we create a `User` instance, set its `name` field, and initialize the `address` field with an `Address` instance. We then print out the different fields of the embedded `Address` document using dot notation.

## Conclusion

MongoEngine's support for embedded documents allows you to create more complex and structured data models within MongoDB. By defining embedded document classes and using them within your main documents, you can organize related data and improve the efficiency of your queries.
