ImageIO is a powerful Python library for reading and writing various image formats. It provides an easy way to manipulate and convert images using its simple API. In this blog post, we will explore how to adjust the animation speed of an image using ImageIO.

## Installation

Before we start, let's make sure we have ImageIO installed. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install imageio
```

We will also need the NumPy library for image manipulation, so let's install it as well:

```python
pip install numpy
```

## Loading and Displaying an Animated Image

First, let's load and display an animated image using ImageIO. We will use the `imread` function to read the image file and the `imshow` function to display it:

```python
import imageio
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the animated image
image = imageio.imread('path/to/animated_image.gif')

# Display the animated image
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

## Adjusting Animation Speed

To adjust the animation speed of the image, we can change the frame duration of each frame. The frame duration determines how long each frame is displayed before moving to the next one.

Here's an example of how to adjust the animation speed by doubling the frame duration:

```python
import imageio

# Load the animated image
image = imageio.imread('path/to/animated_image.gif')

# Double the frame duration
new_duration = image.meta['duration'] * 2
image.meta['duration'] = new_duration

# Save the modified image
imageio.imsave('path/to/modified_image.gif', image)
```

In the code above, we load the animated image using `imageio.imread` and then access the `meta` attribute to get the frame duration. We multiply the frame duration by 2 to double it and assign the new duration back to the `meta` attribute. Finally, we save the modified image using `imageio.imsave`.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to adjust the animation speed of an image using ImageIO in Python. We covered how to load and display an animated image, as well as how to modify the frame duration to control the animation speed. ImageIO provides a simple and intuitive API for working with images, making it a great choice for image manipulation tasks.

Remember to install ImageIO and NumPy before using the code examples provided. Happy coding!
