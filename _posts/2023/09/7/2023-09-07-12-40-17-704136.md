In Python, the `os.path` module provides various methods for manipulating paths. One commonly used method is `isabs()`, which allows you to check whether a given path is an absolute path.

An absolute path is a complete path that specifies the exact location of a file or directory in the filesystem, starting from the root directory. On the other hand, a relative path specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory.

The `isabs()` method takes a path as input and returns `True` if it is an absolute path, and `False` otherwise.

Here's an example usage of `os.path.isabs()`:

```python
import os

path1 = '/usr/local/bin/python'
path2 = 'scripts/myscript.py'
path3 = '../documents/report.docx'

print(os.path.isabs(path1))  # True
print(os.path.isabs(path2))  # False
print(os.path.isabs(path3))  # False
```

In the above example, `path1` is an absolute path starting from the root directory (`/`), while `path2` and `path3` are relative paths.

The output of the code will be:

```
True
False
False
```

By using `os.path.isabs()`, you can easily determine whether a given path is an absolute path or not. This can be particularly useful when dealing with file handling, path manipulation, or writing platform-independent code.

Remember to **handle exceptions** appropriately when working with paths to ensure your code handles unexpected scenarios gracefully.
