Unit testing is an essential part of software development as it helps validate the correctness of individual components or units of code. In Python, the `unittest` module provides a framework for writing and running tests. One important aspect of writing effective unit tests is maintaining their independence, ensuring that each test case is isolated and does not depend on the state of other tests.

Here are some best practices to keep the independence of unittest tests:

## 1. Use setup and teardown methods

The `unittest` module provides `setUp` and `tearDown` methods that can be used to set up the initial conditions before each test and clean up any resources after each test. By using these methods, you can ensure that each test starts with a consistent and known state.

```python
import unittest

class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Set up initial conditions for each test
        
    def tearDown(self):
        # Clean up resources after each test
        
    def test_something(self):
        # Test something
        
    def test_another_thing(self):
        # Test another thing
```

## 2. Use isolated test data

Each test case should use its own test data to avoid any interference from other tests. You can create test data within the test method or use the `setUp` method to initialize the test data. Avoid sharing test data across multiple test cases as it can lead to undesired interactions.

```python
import unittest

class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.test_data = 'some data'
        
    def tearDown(self):
        # Clean up resources after each test
        
    def test_something(self):
        # Use self.test_data for testing
        
    def test_another_thing(self):
        # Use self.test_data for testing
```

## 3. Avoid dependencies between test cases

Each test case should be independent and self-contained. Avoid creating dependencies between test cases, as it can lead to unexpected failures or false positives. If one test case depends on the result or state of another test case, it becomes difficult to isolate and identify the cause of failures.

## 4. Run tests in random order

By default, `unittest` runs test cases in alphabetical order. However, running tests in a random order can help uncover dependencies or assumptions hidden within the tests. Using the `--random` option when running tests can be useful.

```shell
python -m unittest --random my_tests.py
```

## 5. Mock external dependencies

When testing code that depends on external resources or modules, it's a good practice to mock or stub those dependencies. By doing so, you can isolate the code under test and ensure that it behaves correctly without relying on the actual external dependencies. The `unittest.mock` module in Python provides powerful mocking capabilities.

```python
import unittest
from unittest import mock

class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_something_with_mock(self):
        with mock.patch('module_under_test.external_function') as mock_func:
            mock_func.return_value = 'mocked value'
            # Test the code that depends on the external function
```

By following these best practices, you can maintain the independence of your unittest tests in Python, leading to more reliable and accurate testing results. Happy testing!
