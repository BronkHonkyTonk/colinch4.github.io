Recursion is a powerful technique used in programming, where a function calls itself repeatedly until a certain condition is met. However, excessive recursion can lead to a "RecursionError" due to the maximum recursion depth being exceeded. In Python, the default maximum recursion depth is 1000. 

To overcome this limitation and adjust the maximum recursion depth according to our needs, we can make use of the `sys.setrecursionlimit()` function. This function allows us to set a new maximum recursion depth.

## Adjusting the Maximum Recursion Depth

To change the maximum recursion depth, follow these steps:

1. Import the `sys` module:

```python
import sys
```

2. Call the `sys.setrecursionlimit()` function and provide the desired new maximum recursion depth as an argument. For example, to set the new maximum recursion depth to 2000:

```python
sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)
```

## Example Usage

Let's see an example of how to use `sys.setrecursionlimit()`:

```python
import sys

def recursive_function(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return
    else:
        print(n)
        recursive_function(n-1)

sys.setrecursionlimit(5000)  # Set new maximum recursion depth

recursive_function(10)
```

In this example, we have a simple recursive function, `recursive_function()`, that prints the value of `n` and recursively calls itself with `n-1` as the argument, until `n` reaches 0. We set the new maximum recursion depth to 5000 before calling the `recursive_function()`.

## Important Considerations

- **Be cautious when adjusting the maximum recursion depth**. Setting a significantly higher maximum recursion depth may lead to excessive memory usage or even system crashes. It is important to assess the actual needs of your program and set a reasonable maximum recursion depth accordingly.

- **Optimize your recursive functions**. If you frequently encounter RecursionErrors even after increasing the maximum recursion depth, it may be necessary to optimize your code. Consider using techniques like memoization or converting the recursive function to an iterative solution.

By using `sys.setrecursionlimit()`, we have the flexibility to adjust the maximum recursion depth for our Python programs. However, we should always exercise caution and consider the potential consequences of increasing this limit.
