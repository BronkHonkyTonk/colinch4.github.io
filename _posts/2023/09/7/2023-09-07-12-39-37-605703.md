HTTP Digest Authentication is a commonly used method for authenticating users when making HTTP requests. The `requests` library in Python provides a convenient way to handle this type of authentication. In this blog post, we'll explore how to use `requests` to perform digest authentication.

## Installing the `requests` library

Before we start, make sure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using `pip`:

```python
pip install requests
```

## Making a Digest Authenticated Request

To make a digest authenticated request, you'll need the following information:

1. **URL**: The URL of the resource you want to access.
2. **Username and Password**: The credentials of the user you want to authenticate.
3. **Realm**: The authentication realm provided by the server.
4. **Nonce**: A unique value generated by the server for each authentication request.

With these details in hand, you can use the `requests` library to make the authenticated request as follows:

```python
import requests

url = '<URL>'
username = '<USERNAME>'
password = '<PASSWORD>'
realm = '<REALM>'
nonce = '<NONCE>'

# Create a session object
session = requests.Session()

# Generate the Authorization header
authorization_header = requests.auth.HTTPDigestAuth(username, password).build_digest_header(
    requests.Request(method='GET', url=url),
    requests.auth.HTTPDigestAuth.build_digest_dict({'realm': realm, 'nonce': nonce})
)

# Send the request with the Authorization header
response = session.get(url, headers={'Authorization': authorization_header})
```

In the code above, we first import the `requests` library and then define the necessary authentication details. We create a session object which will maintain the state across multiple requests. 

Next, we generate the `Authorization` header using the `HTTPDigestAuth` class provided by `requests`. We build the `Authorization` header by passing the HTTP method, URL, realm, and nonce to the `build_digest_header` method. 

Finally, we send the request with the `Authorization` header included in the `headers` parameter.

## Conclusion

Digest authentication is a secure way to authenticate users when making HTTP requests. The `requests` library provides a simple and straightforward way to handle this type of authentication in Python. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily authenticate requests using the digest authentication method.

Remember to keep your credentials secure and avoid hardcoding them in your code. Consider using environment variables or a secure credentials management system for storing sensitive information.

Happy coding!
