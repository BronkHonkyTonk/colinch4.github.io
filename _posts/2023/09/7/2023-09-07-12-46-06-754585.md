The `os.getuid()` function returns the user ID of the current user. This ID uniquely identifies a user in the operating system. Here's an example usage:

```python
import os

uid = os.getuid()
print("User ID:", uid)
```

The output will be the UID of the current user.

On the other hand, the `os.getgid()` function returns the group ID of the current process. This ID represents the group to which the process belongs. Here's an example usage:

```python
import os

gid = os.getgid()
print("Group ID:", gid)
```

The output will be the GID of the current process.

These functions are particularly useful when working with permission-related operations or when you need to identify the current user or process within your Python script or application.

It's important to note that these functions may behave differently depending on the operating system you are using. Therefore, it is always recommended to consult the official documentation for accurate and detailed information regarding the usage and behavior of these functions in a specific environment.
