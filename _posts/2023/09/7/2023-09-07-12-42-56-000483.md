Here's an example of how you can use `os.path.isfile()` to check if a path is a file:

```python
import os

path = 'path/to/file.txt'

if os.path.isfile(path):
    print(f"{path} is a file.")
else:
    print(f"{path} is not a file.")
```

In the above code, we first import the `os` module. Then, we declare a variable `path` which stores the path to the file we want to check.

Next, we use the `os.path.isfile()` function to check if the `path` variable points to a file. If it does, we print a message saying that the path is a file. Otherwise, we print a message saying that it is not a file.

Remember to replace `'path/to/file.txt'` with the actual path you want to check. You can also use variables or ask for user input to get the path dynamically.
