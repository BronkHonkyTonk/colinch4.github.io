In audio production, **limiting** is an essential technique used to maintain the loudness of a track within a certain range. It helps prevent clipping and distortion, while still allowing the audio to sound punchy and dynamic. 

One powerful library for audio processing in Python is **pydub**. It provides an easy-to-use interface for manipulating audio files. In this blog post, we'll explore how to set up an audio limiter using pydub. 

## Installing pydub
Before we get started, we need to make sure that pydub is installed on our system. We can easily install it via pip by running the following command:

```python
pip install pydub
```

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies, such as ffmpeg, installed as well. You can refer to the pydub documentation for more information on the installation process.

## Setting Up an Audio Limiter
To set up an audio limiter using pydub, we need to follow a few steps. Let's walk through them one by one:

### 1. Importing the necessary libraries
First, let's start by importing the required libraries for our audio limiter:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.playback import play
from pydub.utils import ratio_to_db
```

We import the `AudioSegment` class from `pydub` to work with audio files, the `play` function to play the audio, and the `ratio_to_db` function to convert ratios to decibels.

### 2. Loading the audio file
Next, we need to load the audio file we want to apply the limiter to. Assuming our file is named `input.wav`, we can load it using the `AudioSegment` class:

```python
audio = AudioSegment.from_wav("input.wav")
```

### 3. Applying the limiter
Now, let's apply the limiter to our audio. We can use the `apply_gain_stereo` method of the `AudioSegment` class to set the maximum gain level:

```python
limited_audio = audio.apply_gain_stereo(max_gain=ratio_to_db(0.8))
```

In this example, we set the maximum gain level to 0.8, which means the audio will be limited to 80% of its original loudness.

### 4. Exporting the limited audio
Finally, we need to export the limited audio to a file. We can use the `export` method of the `AudioSegment` class to save the audio to a new file:

```python
limited_audio.export("output.wav", format="wav")
```

Now, the limited audio is saved as `output.wav`.

### 5. Playing the limited audio
If you want to listen to the limited audio without saving it to a file, you can use the `play` function from `pydub.playback`:

```python
play(limited_audio)
```

This will play the limited audio directly in your default audio player.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we've learned how to set up an audio limiter using pydub in Python. We covered the steps of importing the necessary libraries, loading the audio file, applying the limiter, exporting the limited audio, and playing the limited audio. With pydub's powerful features, you have the flexibility to adjust the loudness of your audio files to achieve the desired dynamic range.
