Signals play an important role in Unix-like operating systems. They are used to communicate various events and conditions to running processes. In Python, the `subprocess` module provides a way to interact with subprocesses and handle signals.

One common scenario when dealing with subprocesses is the need to disable or modify the handling of certain signals temporarily. This is particularly useful when you want to prevent a subprocess from being interrupted by signals during critical sections of code execution.

To address this requirement, Python introduced the `subprocess.restore_signals` context manager in version 3.9. This new feature allows you to temporarily modify the signal handling behavior of subprocesses.

## Usage

To use the `subprocess.restore_signals` context manager, you need to import it from the `subprocess` module:

``` python
from subprocess import restore_signals
```

To modify the signal handling behavior, simply create a `with` statement and pass the desired signal names to the `restore_signals` context manager:

``` python
with restore_signals(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIGTERM):
    # Do critical code execution here
    pass
```

In this example, the signal handlers for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals will be temporarily restored to their default behavior. This means that the subprocess will be able to receive and handle these signals while executing the critical code section.

## Practical Example

Let's consider an example where you have a script that spawns a subprocess to perform a long-running task. During this task, you want to ensure that the subprocess is not interrupted by any signals.

``` python
import subprocess
from subprocess import restore_signals
import signal

def run_subprocess():
    subprocess_args = ["python3", "subprocess_task.py"]
    
    with restore_signals(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIGTERM):
        subprocess.run(subprocess_args)
        
run_subprocess()
```

In this example, the `subprocess.run()` function is used to execute the subprocess. By using the `restore_signals` context manager, the interruptions caused by `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals are temporarily disabled. This ensures that the subprocess can complete its task without being interrupted.

## Conclusion

The addition of the `subprocess.restore_signals` context manager in Python 3.9 provides a clean and convenient way to modify the signal handling behavior of subprocesses. It allows you to temporarily disable or modify the handling of specific signals during critical sections of code execution. This feature is particularly useful when you want to prevent interruptions and ensure the smooth execution of subprocess tasks.
