The syntax of `os.path.relpath()` is as follows:

```python
os.path.relpath(path, start)
```

Here, `path` is the absolute or relative path to a file or directory that you want to find the relative path for, and `start` is the directory from which you want to start measuring the relative path. If you omit `start`, it defaults to the current working directory.

Let's see an example to understand how `os.path.relpath()` works:

```python
import os

# Define the absolute or relative paths
path_to_file = '/Users/username/Documents/file.txt'
start_directory = '/Users/username/Documents/projects/'

# Get the relative path from the start_directory to path_to_file
relative_path = os.path.relpath(path_to_file, start_directory)

# Print the relative path
print(relative_path)
```

Output:
```
../file.txt
```

In the example above, we are using the `os.path.relpath()` function to find the relative path from the `start_directory` to `path_to_file`. The `start_directory` is `/Users/username/Documents/projects/` and the `path_to_file` is `/Users/username/Documents/file.txt`. The resulting relative path is `../file.txt`, indicating that the file `file.txt` is one directory up from the `start_directory`.

Using `os.path.relpath()` can be particularly useful when you need to generate relative paths to access files or directories from a given starting point, especially when dealing with complex directory structures or when you want to make your code more portable.

Remember to import the `os` module before using `os.path.relpath()`.
