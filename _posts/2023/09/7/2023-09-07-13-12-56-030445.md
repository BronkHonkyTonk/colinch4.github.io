In Python, the `shutil` module provides a `copyfileobj()` function which allows you to copy the contents of one file object to another. This can be particularly useful when you want to copy the contents of a file-like object, such as a network socket or a StringIO object, to another file.

## Usage

The basic syntax of the `copyfileobj()` function is as follows:

```python
import shutil

shutil.copyfileobj(src_file, dst_file, length=16*1024)
```

The function takes three arguments:

- `src_file`: The source file-like object from which the content will be copied.
- `dst_file`: The destination file-like object to which the content will be copied.
- `length`: The optional buffer size. It specifies the number of bytes to be copied at a time. The default value is 16 KB.

## Examples

Let's see a couple of examples to understand how `copyfileobj()` works.

### Example 1: Copying a file-like object to a file

```python
import shutil
from io import BytesIO

# Create a file-like object with some content
src_file = BytesIO(b"This is the content of the source file.")

# Open a destination file in binary mode
with open("destination.txt", "wb") as dst_file:
    shutil.copyfileobj(src_file, dst_file)
```

In this example, we use the `BytesIO` class from the `io` module to create a file-like object `src_file` with some content. Then, we open a destination file `destination.txt` using the `open()` function and pass it as the `dst_file` argument to `copyfileobj()`. The content of the `src_file` will be copied to `destination.txt`.

### Example 2: Copying data from a socket to a file

```python
import shutil
import socket

# Create a socket object
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect to a remote server
sock.connect(("example.com", 80))

# Open a file in binary mode to store the received data
with open("received_data.bin", "wb") as dst_file:
    shutil.copyfileobj(sock.makefile(), dst_file)
```

In this example, we create a socket object `sock` and connect it to a remote server. Then, we open a file `received_data.bin` using the `open()` function in binary mode. We pass `sock.makefile()` as the `src_file` argument to `copyfileobj()`, which enables us to copy the data received from the socket to the file.

## Conclusion

The `shutil.copyfileobj()` function in the `shutil` module provides a convenient way to copy the contents of one file-like object to another. It offers flexibility and simplicity when dealing with different types of file-like objects, making it a useful tool in Python file manipulation tasks.
