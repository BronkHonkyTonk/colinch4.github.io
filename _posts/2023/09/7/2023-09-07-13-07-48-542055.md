If you are working with Python on a Windows machine, you may at some point need to determine the version of Windows you are running. Luckily, the `sys` module in Python provides a way to obtain this information with the `winver` attribute.

The `winver` attribute returns a string representation of the Windows version that is currently running. This can be useful when developing applications that have specific requirements based on the operating system.

To use `sys.winver`, you need to import the `sys` module. Then, simply access the `winver` attribute and assign it to a variable. Finally, you can print the value of the variable to see the Windows version.

The code snippet above demonstrates how to use `sys.winver` to retrieve the Windows version in Python. After running this code, the Windows version will be printed to the console.

Keep in mind that this code will only work on Windows machines. If you try to run it on a different operating system, such as macOS or Linux, you may encounter an error.
