Moviepy is a powerful Python library that allows you to manipulate and create videos. It provides a simple and intuitive API for editing videos, such as cropping, resizing, adding texts or effects, and much more. In this blog post, we will explore how to use moviepy with free video sources.

## Installing Moviepy

Before we get started, let's make sure you have moviepy installed. You can install it using pip with the following command:

```
pip install moviepy
```

## Finding Free Video Sources

To use moviepy with free video sources, there are a few websites where you can find videos that are licensed under Creative Commons or public domain. Some popular websites include:

- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/videos/)
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/videos/)
- [Videvo](https://www.videvo.net/)

These websites offer a wide variety of videos in different categories. Make sure to check the license of the video to ensure it is free to use.

## Integrating Free Videos with Moviepy

Once you have downloaded a video from a free source, you can start using it with moviepy. Here's an example of how you can create a video clip using a free video source:

```python
import moviepy.editor as mp

# Load the video clip
video = mp.VideoFileClip('path/to/your/video.mp4')

# Perform operations on the video clip (e.g., resize, crop, add effects)
# For example, let's resize the video to 720x480
video_resized = video.resize((720, 480))

# Create a new video file with the resized clip
video_resized.write_videofile('path/to/your/resized_video.mp4')
```

In this example, we first load the video using `VideoFileClip` function from moviepy. Then, we can apply various operations on the video clip such as resizing, cropping, adding effects, or overlaying text. Finally, we can save the modified video clip using the `write_videofile` method.

Make sure to replace `'path/to/your/video.mp4'` with the actual path to your downloaded video file and `'path/to/your/resized_video.mp4'` with the desired path for the resized video.

## Conclusion

With moviepy and free video sources, you have the ability to create amazing videos using Python. Whether you are editing videos for personal projects or professional purposes, moviepy provides a powerful and flexible solution. By leveraging free video sources, you can enhance your video editing capabilities without worrying about copyright issues.
