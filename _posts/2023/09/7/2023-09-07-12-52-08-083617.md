In Python, the `sys` module provides access to system-specific parameters and functions. One of the attributes in this module is `sys.__stdin__`, which represents the original standard input stream.

The standard input stream is a way to receive input from the user or from another program. It is commonly used when reading data from the keyboard or when redirecting input from a file.

With `sys.__stdin__`, you can interact with the standard input stream to read input and collect user data.

### Reading Input from `sys.__stdin__`

To read input from `sys.__stdin__`, you can use the `readline()` method. This method reads a line from the input stream and returns it as a string. Here's an example:

```python
import sys

# Read a single line from the standard input stream
line = sys.__stdin__.readline()

# Print the input
print("Input:", line)
```

In the above code, the `readline()` method is called on `sys.__stdin__` to read a line from the standard input stream. The line is then printed using the `print()` function.

### Redirecting Input

The standard input stream can be redirected to read input from a file instead of the keyboard. This can be useful when testing with predefined input data. To redirect the input, you can use the command line input redirection operators.

For example, if you have a file called `input.txt` containing the input data, you can redirect the input to read from the file like this:

```bash
python script.py < input.txt
```

In the above command, the `<` operator redirects the input to read from `input.txt`, and `script.py` is the Python script that uses `sys.__stdin__` to read the input.

### Conclusion

The `sys.__stdin__` attribute in Python provides access to the original standard input stream. You can use it to read input from the user or redirect input from a file. This is a powerful tool for collecting user data and automating tasks that require input interaction.

Remember to use the appropriate methods, like `readline()`, to read input from `sys.__stdin__`. Experiment with redirecting input to test your code with different input scenarios.

So, try using `sys.__stdin__` in your Python programs to handle input effectively and efficiently!
