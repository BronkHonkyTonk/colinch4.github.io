## Introduction
In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `shutil` module in Python to selectively copy or move files based on a specific time range. The `shutil` module provides a high-level interface for file operations, making it convenient to manipulate files and directories in Python.

## Selecting Files by Time Using `os` module
Before we dive into using `shutil`, let's first understand how to select files based on a specific time range using the `os` module. The `os` module provides several functions for interacting with the operating system, including file operations.

```python
import os
import datetime

def get_files_in_time_range(directory, start_time, end_time):
    files_in_range = []

    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            file_time = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getmtime(file_path))
            
            if start_time <= file_time <= end_time:
                files_in_range.append(file_path)

    return files_in_range
```

In the above code, the `get_files_in_time_range` function takes three parameters: `directory` (the root directory to search for files), `start_time`, and `end_time` (the time range to filter files). It recursively walks through the given directory, and for each file encountered, it retrieves the file's last modification time using `os.path.getmtime`. If the file's time falls within the specified range, it appends the file path to the `files_in_range` list. Finally, the function returns the list of files within the specified time range.

## Copying or Moving Files Using `shutil` module
Once we have the list of files within the desired time range, we can use the `shutil` module to copy or move those files to a new location. The `shutil` module provides functions like `shutil.copy` and `shutil.move` for this purpose.

```python
import shutil

def copy_files(files, destination):
    for file in files:
        shutil.copy(file, destination)

def move_files(files, destination):
    for file in files:
        shutil.move(file, destination)
```

The `copy_files` function takes the list of files as well as a `destination` directory path. It iterates over each file in the list and copies it to the specified destination using `shutil.copy`.

Similarly, the `move_files` function takes the list of files and the destination directory. It iterates over each file and moves it to the destination directory using `shutil.move`.

## Conclusion
Using the `shutil` module in combination with the `os` module, we can easily select files based on a specific time range and perform operations like copying or moving them to another directory. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as organizing files, creating backups, or archiving data. By understanding the capabilities of these modules, you can efficiently manage and manipulate files in Python.
