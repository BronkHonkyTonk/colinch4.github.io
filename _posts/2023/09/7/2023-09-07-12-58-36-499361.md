In this blog post, we will explore how to perform **비동기 파일 업로드 (asynchronous file uploads)** using the `aiohttp` library in Python. Asynchronous file uploading can be useful in scenarios where we don't want our application to be blocked while waiting for the file to finish uploading.

## What is aiohttp?

**aiohttp** is an asynchronous HTTP client/server library for Python. It allows us to build web applications, web services, and perform HTTP requests in an asynchronous and non-blocking manner.

## Uploading Files asynchronously with aiohttp

To begin, first, make sure you have `aiohttp` installed. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install aiohttp
```

To upload files asynchronously, we need to use the `aiohttp.ClientSession` class and its `post` method to send a POST request with the file data. Here's an example code snippet to demonstrate how to upload a file asynchronously:

```python
import aiohttp

async def upload_file(file_path):
    url = 'https://your-upload-endpoint.com/upload'  # Replace with your actual upload endpoint
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.post(url, data=open(file_path, 'rb')) as response:
            if response.status == 200:
                print('File uploaded successfully!')
            else:
                print('Failed to upload file.')

file_path = 'path/to/file.txt'  # Replace with the path to your actual file
asyncio.run(upload_file(file_path))
```

In the above example, we define an asynchronous function `upload_file` that takes `file_path` as an argument. Within the function, we create a `ClientSession` using the `async with` statement, which automatically closes the session after we finish using it. 

We then use the session's `post` method to send the file data to the specified URL. In this example, we simply open the file using `open` and pass the file object to the `data` parameter. Make sure to replace `'https://your-upload-endpoint.com/upload'` with the actual URL of your file upload endpoint.

Finally, we check the response status code to determine if the file was uploaded successfully or not.

To run the code, we use `asyncio.run` to execute the `upload_file` function asynchronously.

That's it! You have now successfully uploaded a file asynchronously using `aiohttp` library in Python.

## Summary

In this blog post, we explored how to perform asynchronous file uploads using the `aiohttp` library in Python. We discussed the basics of `aiohttp` and demonstrated how to upload files asynchronously using the `ClientSession` class. Asynchronous file uploading can help improve the performance and responsiveness of our applications, especially when dealing with large files or multiple file uploads simultaneously.
