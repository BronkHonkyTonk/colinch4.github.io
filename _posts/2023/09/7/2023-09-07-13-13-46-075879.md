The `subprocess` module in Python allows us to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. One of the essential features of `subprocess` is the ability to set the standard output handle.

## What is a standard output handle?

In the context of subprocess operations, a standard output handle refers to the mechanism through which a program writes its output. By default, the standard output handle is set to the console where the program is executed. However, with `subprocess`, we can redirect this output to other sources, such as files or variables.

## Using `subprocess.STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE`

To set the standard output handle using `subprocess`, we can make use of the `stdout` parameter in the `subprocess.Popen()` function. By default, `stdout` is set to `None`, which means the output will be redirected to the console.

However, by specifying a value for `stdout`, we can redirect the output to other destinations. In this case, we can use the `subprocess.STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE` constant.

### Example

```python
import subprocess

# Create a subprocess with the standard output handle set to subprocess.STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE
process = subprocess.Popen(['ls'], stdout=subprocess.STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE)

# Wait for the process to complete
process.wait()
```

In the example above, we create a subprocess using the `Popen()` function, passing the command `ls` as an argument. We set the `stdout` parameter to `subprocess.STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE`, which redirects the output to the standard output handle. Finally, we wait for the process to complete by calling `process.wait()`.

By using `subprocess.STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE`, we can easily redirect the output of a subprocess to different destinations and capture or process it as needed.

## Conclusion

Setting the standard output handle using `subprocess.STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE` in Python allows us to redirect the output of a subprocess to different sources. This can be useful for capturing and processing the output in our Python code.
