In JavaScript, handling user input is a common task when developing web applications. One technique that can be used to handle user input is the **nullish coalescing** operator. This operator provides a concise way to handle cases where a user input value may be null or undefined.

## What is Nullish Coalescing Operator?

The nullish coalescing operator (sometimes referred to as the "null propagation operator") is represented by two question marks `??`. It is used to **coalesce** (i.e., combine) two values, returning the first non-nullish value.

## Using Nullish Coalescing to Handle User Input

When dealing with user input, it is common to handle cases where the input value can be empty, null, or undefined. Instead of using traditional conditional statements like `if` or ternary operators, the nullish coalescing operator provides a more concise way to check and handle such cases.

```javascript
let userInput = null;
let defaultValue = "No value provided";

let result = userInput ?? defaultValue;

console.log(result); // Output: "No value provided"
```

In the code snippet above, the `userInput` variable is assigned the value of `null`, and the `defaultValue` variable is assigned the string "No value provided". The nullish coalescing operator `??` is then used to check if the `userInput` is null or undefined. Since it is indeed null, the operator returns the value of `defaultValue`.

If the `userInput` variable had a non-nullish value, the nullish coalescing operator would return that value instead. For example:

```javascript
let userInput = "Hello";
let defaultValue = "No value provided";

let result = userInput ?? defaultValue;

console.log(result); // Output: "Hello"
```

In this case, the `userInput` variable has the value "Hello", so the nullish coalescing operator returns that value instead of the `defaultValue`.

## Conclusion

The nullish coalescing operator in JavaScript provides a concise way to handle user input values that can be null or undefined. By using the `??` operator, you can easily check and handle these cases without the need for lengthy conditional statements. This can help improve code readability and reduce the chances of introducing bugs. **#Javascript #NullishCoalescing**
