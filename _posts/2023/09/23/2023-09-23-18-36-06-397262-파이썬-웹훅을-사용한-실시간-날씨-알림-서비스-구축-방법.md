In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a real-time weather notification service using Python webhooks. Webhooks allow us to receive real-time data from external sources and trigger actions based on that data. We will be using the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and send notifications to users.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following set up:

- Python installed on your machine
- OpenWeatherMap API key (you can sign up for a free account at https://openweathermap.org)
- A web framework of your choice (e.g., Flask, Django)

## Step 1: Setting Up the Webhook Endpoint

First, we need to set up the webhook endpoint to receive weather data from OpenWeatherMap. Assuming you have a web framework already set up, create a route for the webhook endpoint:

```python
@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    data = request.json
    # Process the received weather data and trigger notifications
    # ...
    return jsonify(success=True)
```

## Step 2: Fetching Weather Data

Next, we need to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Make a GET request to the API endpoint and retrieve the necessary weather information:

```python
import requests

API_KEY = 'your_openweathermap_api_key'
CITY_NAME = 'your_city_name'

url = f'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={CITY_NAME}&appid={API_KEY}'

response = requests.get(url)
weather_data = response.json()
# Process the weather_data
```

## Step 3: Processing Weather Data and Sending Notifications

Once we have the weather data, we can process the data and trigger notifications to users. Depending on your requirements, you can send notifications through email, SMS, or push notifications. Here is an example of sending an email notification using the `smtplib` module:

```python
import smtplib

def send_email_notification(subject, message):
    sender_email = 'your_email@example.com'
    receiver_email = 'receiver_email@example.com'
    password = 'your_email_password'

    with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as server:
        server.starttls()
        server.login(sender_email, password)
        server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, f'Subject: {subject}\n\n{message}')
```

Inside the webhook endpoint, process the weather data and trigger the desired notifications:

```python
@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    data = request.json
    # Process the received weather data
    # ...
    send_email_notification('Weather Update', 'Current temperature: 29°C')
    return jsonify(success=True)
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to build a real-time weather notification service using Python webhooks. We set up a webhook endpoint to receive weather data from OpenWeatherMap API, fetched the data, processed it, and triggered email notifications. This is just one example, and you can extend the service to send notifications through other channels based on your requirements.
