In Python, sets are a built-in data type that represent a collection of unique elements. Sets can be manipulated using various operations, including union, intersection, and difference. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform these operations using Python.

### Union (합집합)

The union of two sets A and B is a set that contains all the elements from both A and B. In Python, the union operation can be performed using the `union()` method or the `|` operator. Here's an example:

```python
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}

union_set = A.union(B)
# or union_set = A | B

print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### Intersection (교집합)

The intersection of two sets A and B is a set that contains only the elements that are common to both A and B. Python provides the `intersection()` method or the `&` operator to perform the intersection operation. Here's an example:

```python
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}

intersection_set = A.intersection(B)
# or intersection_set = A & B

print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3}
```

### Difference (차집합)

The difference between two sets A and B is a set that contains the elements that are in A but not in B. The difference operation can be performed in Python using the `difference()` method or the `-` operator. Here's an example:

```python
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}

difference_set = A.difference(B)
# or difference_set = A - B

print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}
```

### Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to perform union, intersection, and difference operations on sets in Python. Sets are a powerful data type that can be used for various purposes, including removing duplicates from a list, checking for membership, and performing set operations. Understanding these operations is essential for working with sets effectively.
