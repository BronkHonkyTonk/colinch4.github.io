In this blog post, we will explore how to set up a timer using Python for a shaft or axis. The timer will allow us to track the time it takes for the shaft or axis to complete a full rotation or any desired movement. This can be useful in various applications such as robotics, industrial automation, or even games.

## Setting up the Timer

To set up the timer, we will be using the `time` module in Python. This module provides various functions to handle time-related tasks. To begin, let's import the `time` module:

```python
import time
```

Next, we need to initialize the timer. We can do this by calling the `time()` function from the `time` module, which will return the current time in seconds:

```python
start_time = time.time()
```

Now that we have the start time, we can perform the desired action with the shaft or axis. For example, let's assume we want to rotate a shaft:

```python
# Code to rotate the shaft or axis goes here
```

After the desired action is completed, we can calculate the elapsed time by subtracting the start time from the current time:

```python
end_time = time.time()
elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
```

## Formatting the Timer Output

By default, the `elapsed_time` variable will be in seconds. However, we can format it to a more readable format such as hours, minutes, and seconds. Here's a function that takes care of the formatting:

```python
def format_time(seconds):
    minutes, seconds = divmod(seconds, 60)
    hours, minutes = divmod(minutes, 60)
    return "%d:%02d:%02d" % (hours, minutes, seconds)
```

To use this function, simply pass the `elapsed_time` to it:

```python
formatted_time = format_time(elapsed_time)
print("Elapsed time:", formatted_time)
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to set up a timer for a shaft or axis in Python using the `time` module. By initializing the timer, performing the desired action, and calculating the elapsed time, we can accurately measure the time it takes for the movement. Additionally, we have seen how to format the time output for better readability.
