In Python, classes are a fundamental building block for creating objects with specific properties and behaviors. Alongside instance variables and instance methods, **class variables** and **class methods** provide additional functionality for managing data and behaviors that are shared among all instances of a class.

## 클래스 변수 (Class Variables)

A **class variable** is a variable that is shared by all instances (objects) of a class. It is defined within the class but outside any instance methods. Class variables are accessed using the class name, followed by the dot notation.

```python
class Car:
    num_of_wheels = 4  # class variable

    def __init__(self, model, color):
        self.model = model
        self.color = color

car1 = Car("Honda", "Blue")
car2 = Car("Toyota", "Red")

print(car1.num_of_wheels)  # Output: 4
print(car2.num_of_wheels)  # Output: 4

print(Car.num_of_wheels)   # Output: 4
```

In the above example, the `num_of_wheels` variable is a class variable, and it is shared among all instances of the `Car` class. Both `car1` and `car2` can access and modify this variable.

## 클래스 메서드 (Class Methods)

A **class method** is a method that belongs to the class rather than to any particular instance of the class. It is defined using the `@classmethod` decorator and can be called both on the class itself and on the instances of the class.

```python
class Car:
    num_of_wheels = 4  # class variable

    @classmethod
    def get_num_of_wheels(cls):
        return cls.num_of_wheels

car1 = Car()
car2 = Car()

print(Car.get_num_of_wheels())    # Output: 4
print(car1.get_num_of_wheels())   # Output: 4
print(car2.get_num_of_wheels())   # Output: 4
```

In the above example, the `get_num_of_wheels` method is a class method that returns the value of the `num_of_wheels` class variable. The method is defined using the `@classmethod` decorator and takes the `cls` argument, which refers to the class itself. The class method can be called using the class name (`Car.get_num_of_wheels()`) or on any instance of the class (`car1.get_num_of_wheels()`).

## Conclusion

Class variables and class methods are powerful tools in Python for managing data and functionality that are shared among all instances of a class. Understanding how to use them effectively can help in creating more efficient and organized code.
