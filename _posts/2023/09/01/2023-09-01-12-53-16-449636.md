## Introduction
Working with files is a common task in many programming projects. In Python, you can read and write files easily using the built-in functions and libraries. In this blog post, we will explore how to read and write files within a directory in Python.

## Reading Files
To read a file within a specific directory, you can use the `open()` function in Python. Let's assume we have a file named "example.txt" located in the "files" directory. Here's an example of how to read the contents of this file:

```python
with open("files/example.txt", "r") as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)
```

In the code above, we use the `open()` function to open the file in read mode (`"r"`) and assign it to a file object called `file`. The with statement ensures that the file is automatically closed after we finish reading it. We then use the `read()` method to read the entire contents of the file and print it.

## Writing Files
To write data to a file within a directory, we can use the `open()` function once again, but this time in write mode (`"w"`). Let's create a new file named "output.txt" and write some text into it:

```python
with open("files/output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")
```

In the code above, we open the file "output.txt" within the "files" directory in write mode. We use the `write()` method of the file object to write the text "Hello, World!" into the file. Note that if the file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

## Conclusion
Reading and writing files within a directory in Python is straightforward. By using the `open()` function with the appropriate mode, we can easily read the contents of a file or write data into a new file. Remember to always close the file after you finish reading or writing to it to free up system resources.
