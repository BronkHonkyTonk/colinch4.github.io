When working with network programming in Python, you often need to deal with **socket addresses**. These addresses are used to identify and establish communication between different network devices. However, socket addresses are represented differently at the application level and the lower level network protocols, such as IP addresses and port numbers. 

In Python, you can use the `socket` module to perform socket address conversion easily. This module provides various functions and methods for manipulating socket addresses.

Let's look at some common methods to convert socket addresses in Python:

## 1. IP address to socket address

To convert an IP address to a socket address, you can use the `socket.getaddrinfo()` function. This function takes the IP address and the port number as input and returns a list of socket addresses in the form of tuples:

```python
import socket

# IP address
ip_address = '127.0.0.1'

# Port number
port = 8000

# Get socket addresses
socket_addresses = socket.getaddrinfo(ip_address, port)

# Display the socket addresses
for addr in socket_addresses:
    print(addr[4])
```

In the above example, we convert the IP address "127.0.0.1" and the port number 8000 to socket addresses. We then iterate over the list of socket addresses and print them.

## 2. Socket address to IP address

To extract the IP address from a socket address, you can simply access the element at index 0 of the socket address tuple:

```python
import socket

# Socket address
socket_address = ('127.0.0.1', 8000)

# Extract the IP address
ip_address = socket_address[0]

# Display the IP address
print(ip_address)
```

In this example, we have a socket address in the form of a tuple ('127.0.0.1', 8000). We extract the IP address by accessing the element at index 0 of the tuple.

## 3. Socket address to port number

To extract the port number from a socket address, you can access the element at index 1 of the socket address tuple:

```python
import socket

# Socket address
socket_address = ('127.0.0.1', 8000)

# Extract the port number
port = socket_address[1]

# Display the port number
print(port)
```

Here, we have a socket address in the form of a tuple ('127.0.0.1', 8000). We extract the port number by accessing the element at index 1 of the tuple.

These are just a few examples of how you can convert socket addresses in Python. The `socket` module provides more functions and methods for manipulating socket addresses, so feel free to explore the Python documentation for additional information.

Happy coding!
