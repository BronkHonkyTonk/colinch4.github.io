When writing code in Python, it is important to follow certain naming conventions for modules and packages. Consistent and meaningful names will make your code more readable and maintainable.

## Module Naming Style

Modules in Python are files that contain Python code. To name a module, adhere to the following guidelines:

- Use lowercase letters
- Separate words with underscores

For example, if you have a module that contains utility functions for working with strings, you can name it `string_utils.py`. This follows the convention of using lowercase letters and underscores to separate words.

## Package Naming Style

Packages in Python are directories that contain multiple modules. When naming a package, you should also follow the naming style to maintain consistency across your codebase.

- Use lowercase letters
- Separate words with underscores

For example, if you have a package that contains modules related to data visualization, you can name it `data_visualization`. This naming style helps to clearly identify the purpose or content of the package.

## Recommended Naming Style

In addition to the naming conventions mentioned above, it is also recommended to use **descriptive** and **meaningful** names for your modules and packages. This will make it easier for other developers to understand the purpose and functionality of your code.

Avoid using generic names like `utils` or `helpers` for your modules and packages. Instead, choose names that accurately reflect the functionality they provide. This will make your code more self-explanatory and easier to maintain in the long run.

```python
# Example of a module with descriptive and meaningful name
# string_utils.py
def reverse_string(input_string):
    return input_string[::-1]

def capitalize_string(input_string):
    return input_string.capitalize()
```

```python
# Example of a package with descriptive and meaningful name
# data_visualization/
# ├── bar_chart.py
# ├── line_chart.py
# └── pie_chart.py
```

By following these naming conventions and guidelines, you can improve the clarity and readability of your Python code. Consistency in naming will also make it easier for you and other developers to navigate and understand your codebase.
