When working with Apache Kafka, it is common to use consumer groups to achieve parallel processing of messages from Kafka topics. Consumer groups enable multiple consumers to work together as a group and distribute the load of reading messages from topics.

## What is a Kafka Topic Group?

A Kafka topic group refers to a group of consumers that work collectively to process messages from a specific Kafka topic. Each consumer within the group is assigned a subset of the partitions of the topic, allowing them to process messages in parallel.

## Consumer Group Concepts

To understand Kafka topic groups, it is important to familiarize yourself with a few key concepts related to consumer groups:

1. **Consumer**: A consumer is an application or service that reads messages from Kafka topics. Each consumer belongs to a consumer group and is responsible for consuming messages from one or more topic partitions.

2. **Consumer Group**: A consumer group is a logical entity that consists of multiple consumers. Each consumer within the group is assigned to a subset of the partitions of the topic being consumed.

3. **Partition**: A topic in Kafka is divided into multiple partitions, which allows for parallel processing of messages. Each partition is ordered and can be consumed by only one consumer within a consumer group at a time.

4. **Offset**: An offset is a unique identifier that determines the position of a message within a partition. Each consumer group keeps track of the offset for each partition it is consuming, allowing for reliable message processing.

## Creating a Kafka Topic Group

To create a Kafka topic group and start consuming messages from a topic, you need to take the following steps:

1. **Create a Consumer Group**: Define a unique identifier for your consumer group, which will be used by consumers to join the group. This identifier can be any string.

2. **Assign Topics to Consumer Group**: Specify the topics that the consumer group will consume messages from. Each consumer within the group will be assigned a subset of the partitions of these topics.

3. **Start Consumers**: Start one or more consumers using the consumer group identifier. Each consumer will be responsible for consuming messages from its assigned partitions.

## Example Code in Java

Here is an example code snippet in Java that shows how to create a Kafka topic group using the KafkaConsumer API:

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer;
import java.util.Properties;

public class KafkaTopicGroupExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Configure consumer properties
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.setProperty("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
        props.setProperty("group.id", "my-consumer-group");
        props.setProperty("key.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
        props.setProperty("value.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");

        // Create a Kafka consumer
        KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);

        // Subscribe to topics
        consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList("my-topic"));

        // Start consuming messages
        while (true) {
            consumer.poll(100).forEach(record -> {
                System.out.println("Received message: " + record.value());
            });
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Kafka topic groups with consumer groups provide an efficient way to process messages from Kafka topics in parallel. By assigning partitions to consumers within a group, you can achieve high throughput and scale your message processing capabilities.
