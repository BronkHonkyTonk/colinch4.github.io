Here's an example of how to label an image:

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
```

In this example, replace "path/to/image.jpg" with the actual path to your image file, and "Description of the image" with a concise and descriptive text that represents the content or purpose of the image. This helps improve accessibility and search engine optimization.

Remember to provide relevant and accurate descriptions to ensure that all users, including those with visual impairments, can understand the purpose of the image.
