Have you ever experienced a delay or a stuck feeling while typing or playing a game on your keyboard? One possible reason for this issue is when you are pressing multiple keys simultaneously, known as a "chord" input. Chord input is commonly used in gaming and music production, but it can also occur during regular typing. In this blog post, we will delve into the concept of chord input and discuss how it affects your keyboard experience.

## How Chord Input Works

When you press a key on your keyboard, a signal is sent to your computer indicating which key has been pressed. However, when two or more keys are pressed together, the keyboard has to send a combined signal to the computer that represents the simultaneous key presses. This process is known as "chording."

Typically, keyboards have a limited number of simultaneous key presses they can detect, referred to as "rollover." For example, a keyboard with 2-key rollover can only detect two keys pressed simultaneously, while a 6-key rollover keyboard can detect up to six keys. If you exceed the rollover limit, some key presses may not register or may be delayed, resulting in a frustrating experience.

## Impact on Typing and Gaming

Chord input can have a significant impact on your typing speed and gaming performance. If you frequently type fast or use keyboard shortcuts that involve multiple keys, a keyboard with a higher rollover limit can greatly improve your typing accuracy and speed. Similarly, in gaming, precise and fast key presses are crucial, especially in competitive gaming scenarios. A keyboard with a high rollover limit ensures that all your key inputs are accurately registered without any delays.

## How to Test Chord Input

If you want to check the rollover capabilities of your keyboard, there are websites and software available that can help you assess the number of keys your keyboard can detect simultaneously. One popular website is [KeyboardTester.com](https://www.keyboardtester.com/tester.html). By pressing multiple keys simultaneously, you can determine the rollover limit of your keyboard and understand its capability.

## Conclusion

Understanding chord input and the rollover limit of your keyboard can enhance your typing and gaming experience. Investing in a keyboard that supports a higher rollover limit can prevent delays, missed inputs, and frustrations. So, the next time you find yourself waiting for the second key of a chord, consider upgrading your keyboard to improve your efficiency and accuracy.
