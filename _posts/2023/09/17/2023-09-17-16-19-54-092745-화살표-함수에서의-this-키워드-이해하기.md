Arrow functions are a popular feature in modern JavaScript that provide a more concise syntax for writing functions. One important difference between arrow functions and regular functions is how they handle the `this` keyword.

In regular functions, the value of `this` is determined by how a function is called. However, arrow functions do not have their own `this` value. Instead, they inherit the `this` value from the surrounding scope.

Let's take a closer look at how this works with some examples.

## Example 1: Regular Function

```javascript
function regularFunction() {
  console.log(this);
}

// Calling the function
regularFunction(); // Output: Window
```

In a regular function, the value of `this` depends on how the function is invoked. When called in the global scope or without any specific object context, `this` refers to the global `Window` object.

## Example 2: Arrow Function

```javascript
const arrowFunction = () => {
  console.log(this);
};

// Calling the function
arrowFunction(); // Output: Window
```

In an arrow function, `this` is not bound to the function itself. Instead, it inherits the value of `this` from its surrounding scope, which in this case is the global scope.

## Example 3: Object Method

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  sayHi: () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

person.sayHi(); // Output: undefined
```

In the example above, even though `sayHi` is defined as a method within the `person` object, the arrow function does not have its own `this` value. Instead, it inherits the value of `this` from the surrounding scope, which is the global scope. As a result, `this.name` is undefined.

## Conclusion

In summary, arrow functions in JavaScript do not have their own `this` value. Instead, they inherit the value of `this` from the surrounding scope. This behavior can sometimes lead to unexpected results, especially when using arrow functions as object methods. It is important to understand how `this` works in arrow functions to avoid potential issues in your code.
