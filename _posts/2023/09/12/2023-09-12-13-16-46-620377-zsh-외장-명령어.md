## Introduction
Zsh (Z shell) is a powerful and feature-rich shell that is designed to be an improved alternative to the traditional Bourne shell (sh). One of the strengths of Zsh is its extensive collection of external commands, also known as 외장 명령어 in Korean. These external commands provide additional functionality and empower users to perform various tasks efficiently on the command line.

In this blog post, we will explore some of the commonly used and useful Zsh 외장 명령어 in Linux.

## 1. `git`
Git is a distributed version control system widely used for managing source code. With the `git` command, you can perform various operations, such as initializing a new repository, cloning existing repositories, committing changes, branching, and merging.

```bash
$ git init        # Initialize a new Git repository
$ git clone <URL> # Clone an existing repository
$ git add <file>  # Stage changes for commit
$ git commit -m "commit message" # Commit changes
$ git branch      # List branches
$ git merge <branch> # Merge a branch into the current branch
```

## 2. `docker`
Docker is a popular platform that allows you to build, deploy, and run applications using containerization. Zsh provides the `docker` command to interact with the Docker daemon and manage containers, images, networks, and volumes.

```bash
$ docker run <image>          # Run a container from an image
$ docker ps                   # List running containers
$ docker images               # List available images
$ docker build <path_to_dockerfile> # Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile
$ docker stop <container>     # Stop a running container
$ docker rm <container>       # Remove a container
```

## 3. `awk`
Awk is a versatile pattern scanning and processing language for text files. The `awk` command in Zsh allows you to perform text manipulation and data extraction tasks easily.

```bash
$ awk '/pattern/ { action }' file # Search for a pattern and perform an action
$ awk '{ sum += $1 } END { print sum }' file # Calculate the sum of the first column
$ awk -F',' '{ print $2 }' file    # Print the second field delimited by comma
$ awk '{print NF}' file            # Print the number of fields in each line
$ awk 'length($0) > 80' file       # Filter lines longer than 80 characters
```

## 4. `curl`
Curl is a command-line tool for sending requests to servers and retrieving the responses. Zsh includes the `curl` command to easily fetch data from HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and other protocols.

```bash
$ curl <URL>         # Retrieve the content of a URL and print it to stdout
$ curl -O <URL>      # Download a file from a URL
$ curl -X POST -d "data" <URL> # Send a POST request with data
$ curl -I <URL>      # Fetch only the response headers
$ curl -u user:password <URL> # Authenticate using username and password
```

## 5. `grep`
`grep` is a powerful command-line tool for searching and filtering text based on patterns. With the `grep` command in Zsh, you can easily find specific content in files or output of other commands.

```bash
$ grep 'pattern' file      # Search for a pattern in a file
$ command | grep 'pattern' # Search for a pattern in the output of a command
$ grep -i 'pattern' file   # Perform case-insensitive pattern matching
$ grep -r 'pattern' dir    # Recursively search for a pattern in a directory
$ grep -v 'pattern' file   # Invert the match to exclude lines matching the pattern
```

## Conclusion
These are just a few of the many external commands available in Zsh. By leveraging these commands, you can enhance your command-line experience, streamline your workflows, and boost your productivity on Linux systems. Take some time to explore these commands and experiment with them to unlock their full potential. Happy hacking!
