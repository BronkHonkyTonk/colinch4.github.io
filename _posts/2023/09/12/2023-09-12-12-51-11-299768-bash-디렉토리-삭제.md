When working with Linux command line, it is important to know how to manage directories. In this blog post, we will explore how to delete directories using the Bash shell.

## Deleting a Directory

To delete a directory in Bash, we use the `rm` command followed by the `-r` option, which stands for "recursive". The `rm` command is used to remove files and directories in Linux.

```bash
rm -r <directory_name>
```

The `-r` option is used to remove directories and their contents recursively, meaning that it will remove all files and subdirectories within the specified directory.

## Example Usage

Let's say we have a directory called "my_directory" and we want to delete it. We can use the `rm -r` command as follows:

```bash
rm -r my_directory
```

This command will delete the "my_directory" directory and all its contents.

## Prompt for Confirmation

By default, the `rm -r` command does not prompt for confirmation before deleting the directory. If you want to be prompted before each removal, you can add the `-i` option.

```bash
rm -ri <directory_name>
```

The `-i` option stands for "interactive" and will ask for confirmation before deleting each file and directory.

## Cautionary Note: Be Careful with the `rm` Command

The `rm` command is a powerful tool and it permanently deletes files and directories. **There is no "undelete" option**, so be cautious when using it. Make sure you double-check the directory path and contents before executing the command.

## Conclusion

Deleting directories in Bash is a common task when managing files and directories in Linux. The `rm -r` command allows you to remove directories and their contents recursively. Remember to exercise caution and confirm your actions to avoid accidentally deleting important files or directories.
