When using the Bash shell in a Linux operating system, you may need to create directories to organize your files and projects. In this blog post, we will explore different methods to create directories using Bash commands.

## Method 1: Using the `mkdir` command

The `mkdir` command is the most common way to create directories in Bash. Here's how you can use it:

```bash
mkdir directory_name
```

Replace `directory_name` with the desired name for your directory. This command will create a new directory in your current location.

### Example:

To create a directory named "docs" in your current location, use the following command:

```bash
mkdir docs
```

## Method 2: Creating nested directories

If you need to create a directory within another directory, you can use the `-p` option with the `mkdir` command. This option will create any parent directories that don't exist.

```bash
mkdir -p parent_directory/child_directory
```

Replace `parent_directory` with the name of the parent directory and `child_directory` with the desired name for the nested directory.

### Example:

To create a directory structure with a parent directory named "project" and a nested directory named "src", use the following command:

```bash
mkdir -p project/src
```

## Method 3: Creating multiple directories

In some cases, you may need to create multiple directories simultaneously. To achieve this, you can provide multiple directory names as arguments to the `mkdir` command:

```bash
mkdir directory1 directory2 directory3
```

Simply add additional directory names separated by spaces.

### Example:

To create three directories named "images", "videos", and "documents" in your current location, use the following command:

```bash
mkdir images videos documents
```

## Method 4: Creating directories with specific permissions

By default, when you create a directory using the `mkdir` command, it inherits the permissions of its parent directory. However, you can specify specific permissions using the `-m` option, followed by the octal value representing the desired permissions.

```bash
mkdir -m 755 directory_name
```

Replace `directory_name` with the name of the directory you want to create.

### Example:

To create a directory named "public_html" with permissions set to `755`, use the following command:

```bash
mkdir -m 755 public_html
```

## Conclusion

Creating directories in Bash is a simple and essential task when organizing your files and projects. By using the `mkdir` command with various options, you can easily create directories with specific names, nested structures, and desired permissions. Start organizing your files efficiently with these Bash commands!
