Zsh is a powerful shell that offers advanced features and customization options. One of its standout features is the ability to perform **pattern matching**. Pattern matching allows you to specify a pattern and match it against filenames or strings, making it extremely useful for file manipulation and command-line tasks.

In this blog post, we will explore the various methods of pattern matching in Zsh and demonstrate how they can be used to streamline your Linux workflow.

## Simple Globs

The most basic form of pattern matching in Zsh is done through **globs**. Globs are wildcard characters that allow you to match multiple filenames or strings.

1. Asterisk (`*`): Matches any number of characters, including none.
2. Question mark (`?`): Matches exactly one character.
3. Square brackets (`[]`): Matches any one character listed inside the brackets.
4. Tilde (`~`): Matches any one character not listed inside the brackets.

For example, to list all files with an extension of `.txt` in the current directory, you can use the following command:

```zsh
ls *.txt
```

To match any file with a name that starts with `file` and ends with any letter, you can use:

```zsh
ls file?[a-z]
```

## Extended Globbing

Zsh also supports **extended globbing**, which expands upon the basic globbing functionality by providing additional pattern matching features.

1. Double Asterisk (`**`): Matches files in subdirectories recursively.
2. Extended range expressions (`[::]`): Matches a range of characters or a sequence of characters.
3. Negation (`~`): Matches anything except what is specified.

To find all `.png` files in the current directory and its subdirectories, you can use the following command:

```zsh
ls **/*.png
```

To match files with names containing three letters in the range `m` to `p`, you can use:

```zsh
ls [m-p](#c3)
```

## Brace Expansion

Zsh also supports **brace expansion**, which allows you to generate multiple strings by expanding a pattern inside curly braces.

For example, to create multiple directories with names `folder1`, `folder2`, and `folder3`, you can use the following command:

```zsh
mkdir folder{1..3}
```

You can also combine brace expansion with globbing to perform bulk operations, such as moving or copying multiple files.

## Conclusion

Zsh's pattern matching capabilities, including globs, extended globbing, and brace expansion, provide a convenient and powerful way to manipulate files and perform command-line tasks in Linux. By understanding and utilizing these features, you can enhance your productivity and efficiency in the terminal.
