## Introduction

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform used to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It provides a flexible and extensible architecture that allows users to customize various components of Airflow.

One of the essential aspects of any workflow system is logging. Airflow has built-in logging capabilities that allow users to log various information, such as task statuses, error messages, and debugging information. However, in some cases, you may need more fine-grained control over the logging process.

In this blog post, we will explore how to create a custom log handler in Airflow using Python. This custom log handler will allow us to selectively route logs to different destinations based on our requirements.

## Prerequisites

Before we proceed, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Apache Airflow installed

## Implementing the Custom Log Handler

To create a custom log handler in Airflow, we need to implement a class that extends the `logging.Handler` class from the Python standard library's `logging` module.

Here's an example of how the implementation may look:

```python
import logging

class MyCustomLogHandler(logging.Handler):
    def __init__(self, handler_name):
        super().__init__()
        self.handler_name = handler_name

    def emit(self, record):
        # Implement your custom logic here
        # You can access the log message using `record.msg`
        # and the log level using `record.levelname`

        # Example: Route logs with level INFO to a specific handler
        if record.levelname == "INFO":
            self.route_to_special_handler(record.msg)

    def route_to_special_handler(self, log_message):
        # Implement your logic to route logs to a special handler
        # For example, write logs to a separate file or send them to a different destination
        pass
```

In the above example, we define a custom log handler class `MyCustomLogHandler` that extends the `logging.Handler` class. We override the `emit` method, which is responsible for actually processing the log record.

Inside the `emit` method, you can implement your custom logic to handle the log record. In this example, we check the log level of the record and route logs with level INFO to a special handler by calling the `route_to_special_handler` method.

The `route_to_special_handler` method is where you can implement your custom logic to route logs to a different destination. For example, you can write logs to a separate file or send them to a different logging service.

## Setting up the Custom Log Handler in Airflow

Once you have implemented the custom log handler, you need to configure Airflow to use it. This can be done by updating the Airflow configuration file (`airflow.cfg`).

Locate the `[logging]` section in the `airflow.cfg` file and add or modify the `base_log_folder` key to specify the custom log handler implementation.

For example, to use our `MyCustomLogHandler` class, you can update the `base_log_folder` key as follows:

```ini
[logging]
base_log_folder = airflow.logs
task_log_reader = airflow.utils.log.file_task_handler.FileTaskHandler
task_log_handler = path.to.MyCustomLogHandler
```

Make sure to replace `path.to` with the actual import path of your custom log handler class.

After making the necessary changes, restart the Airflow scheduler and workers for the changes to take effect.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we discussed how to create a custom log handler in Airflow using Python. We saw an example implementation of a custom log handler class and learned how to configure Airflow to use the custom log handler.

Having a custom log handler gives you more control over the logging process in Airflow and allows you to route logs to different destinations based on your specific requirements. This can be particularly useful when dealing with large-scale workflows and complex logging scenarios.

Remember to thoroughly test your custom log handler and ensure it meets your logging needs before deployment.
