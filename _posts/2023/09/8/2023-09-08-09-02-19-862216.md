Pagination is an essential feature in web development to handle large datasets by dividing them into smaller, more manageable chunks. In Django REST Framework (DRF), pagination allows us to control the number of records returned in each API response.

In this blog post, we will explore how to configure pagination in DRF using Python. Let's dive right in!

## Step 1: Install Django REST Framework

First, we need to have Django REST Framework installed in our project. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install djangorestframework
```

## Step 2: Configure Pagination

To configure pagination in DRF, we need to make some changes in our project's settings file (`settings.py`). Open the file and locate the `REST_FRAMEWORK` dictionary. If it doesn't exist, add it to the end of the file.

```python
# settings.py

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 'rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination',
    'PAGE_SIZE': 10,
}
```

In the above code snippet, we set the `DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS` to `rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination`, which is a default pagination class provided by DRF. We also set the `PAGE_SIZE` to 10, which means each API response will contain a maximum of 10 records.

Feel free to adjust the `PAGE_SIZE` according to your requirements.

## Step 3: Implement Pagination in Views

Now that we have configured pagination globally, we need to enable it in our views. In your view class or function, add the pagination class as follows:

```python
from rest_framework.pagination import PageNumberPagination

class MyAPIView(APIView):
    pagination_class = PageNumberPagination

    def get(self, request):
        queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
        paginated_queryset = self.pagination_class().paginate_queryset(queryset, request)
        serializer = MyModelSerializer(paginated_queryset, many=True)
        return self.pagination_class.get_paginated_response(serializer.data)
```

In the above code snippet, we import the `PageNumberPagination` class from `rest_framework.pagination`. Then, we set the `pagination_class` attribute as `PageNumberPagination` in our view. Inside the `get` method, we paginate the queryset based on the request and serialize the paginated queryset.

## Step 4: Test Pagination

Now, you can test the pagination by making API requests to your view. The paginated response will include the paginated records along with links to the next and previous pages.

```
GET /api/myview/
```

The above API request will return the first page of the paginated records.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to configure pagination in DRF using Python. By following these steps, you can easily divide large datasets into smaller pages, improving the performance and user experience of your API.

Implementing pagination is an effective strategy to handle large datasets efficiently. It allows users to navigate through data in a systematic manner.

Feel free to explore different pagination classes provided by DRF, such as `LimitOffsetPagination` and `CursorPagination`, depending on your specific needs.

That's it for now! Hope you found this blog post helpful. Happy coding!
