In this blog post, we will explore how to use regular expressions in Python to remove HTML tags from a string.

HTML tags are used to define the structure and formatting of a webpage. However, there are scenarios where we may need to remove these tags and extract the plain text content. This can be done efficiently using regular expressions.

## Approach

To remove HTML tags using regular expressions, we can use the `re` module in Python. The `re` module provides several methods for searching and manipulating strings based on patterns defined using regular expressions.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates the removal of HTML tags from a string:

```python
import re

def remove_html_tags(html):
    pattern = r"<.*?>"
    clean_text = re.sub(pattern, '', html)
    return clean_text

html_string = "<p>This is <b>bold</b> text with <a href='https://example.com'>link</a>.</p>"
clean_text = remove_html_tags(html_string)
print(clean_text)
```

In the above code, we define a function `remove_html_tags` that takes an HTML string and uses the `re.sub` method to replace all occurrences of HTML tags with an empty string. The regular expression pattern `<.*?>` matches any HTML tag and the `.*?` ensures a non-greedy match, meaning it will stop at the first closing bracket encountered.

The output of the above code will be:

```
This is bold text with link.
```

## Conclusion

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for manipulating and extracting data from strings. In this blog post, we learned how to use regular expressions in Python to remove HTML tags from a string. By leveraging the `re` module and the `re.sub` method, we were able to easily achieve our goal.

Removing HTML tags can be useful in various scenarios, such as web scraping, text analysis, and content parsing. Understanding regular expressions and their usage in Python opens up a world of possibilities for dealing with structured data.
