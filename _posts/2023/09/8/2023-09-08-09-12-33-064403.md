FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and to provide high-performance, asyncio-powered features.

In addition to its powerful features out of the box, FastAPI also supports extension development. This allows developers to build custom functionality on top of the existing framework, tailoring it to their specific needs.

In this blog post, we will explore the process of extending FastAPI and demonstrate how to build custom extensions in Python.

## Why Extend FastAPI?

There are several reasons why you might want to extend FastAPI:

- Add custom functionality: FastAPI provides a solid foundation for building APIs, but sometimes you may need additional features that are not available out of the box.
- Reuse code: Extensions allow you to encapsulate and reuse common code across different FastAPI projects.
- Customize behavior: Extensions enable you to modify or override certain parts of FastAPI to meet specific requirements.
- Integrate with other libraries: You can use extensions to seamlessly integrate FastAPI with other Python libraries or frameworks.


## Building a Custom Extension

To build a custom extension for FastAPI, you will follow these general steps:

1. **Create a new Python package**: Start by creating a new Python package that will contain your extension code. This package will serve as a standalone module that can be installed and imported by other projects.

2. **Implement the extension functionality**: Write the code that implements your custom functionality. This could include adding new endpoints, modifying request/response handling, or any other desired functionality.

3. **Integrate with FastAPI**: To make your extension work seamlessly with FastAPI, you will need to integrate it into the framework. This might involve registering event hooks, modifying the routing system, or implementing middleware.

4. **Package and distribute your extension**: Once your custom extension is complete, package it into a distributable format such as a Python wheel or an installable package. This will allow other developers to easily install and use your extension.

## Example: Custom Authentication Extension

Let's walk through an example to illustrate the process of building a custom extension for FastAPI. We will focus on creating a custom authentication mechanism using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

### Step 1: Create a new package

Start by creating a new Python package for your extension. You can use the `pip` command to create a new package structure:

```python
pip create fastapi-auth-extension
```

This command will create a new directory with the `fastapi-auth-extension` name, containing the necessary files and folders for your extension.

### Step 2: Implement the extension functionality

In the newly created package, create a new Python module `auth_extension.py`. This module will contain the code responsible for handling JWT authentication.

```python
from fastapi import HTTPException
from fastapi import Depends

def authenticate_user(token: str):
    # Implementation of JWT authentication logic goes here
    # ...

def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(authenticate_user)):
    # Implementation of retrieving current user logic goes here
    # ...

```

In the above code, we defined two functions. The `authenticate_user` function handles the authentication logic using JWT, and the `get_current_user` function retrieves the current user based on the authenticated token.

### Step 3: Integrate with FastAPI

To integrate our custom authentication extension with FastAPI, we need to register it as a dependency in our main application.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_auth_extension import auth_extension

app = FastAPI()

app.include_router(auth_extension.router)
```

Here, we are importing the `auth_extension` module from our newly created package and including its router in the main FastAPI application.

### Step 4: Package and distribute your extension

To make your custom extension easily installable, package it using the `setuptools` library. Create a `setup.py` file in the root of your extension package:

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='fastapi-auth-extension',
    version='0.1',
    packages=find_packages(),
)
```

Replace `fastapi-auth-extension` with the desired name of your extension package.

With the `setup.py` file in place, you can now build your extension package using the following command:

```python
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

This command will create a distribution package that can be installed using `pip` or `easy_install`.

## Conclusion

FastAPI allows for easy extension development, enabling you to add custom functionality, integrate with other libraries, and customize the behavior of your API. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can build powerful and reusable extensions that enhance the capabilities of your FastAPI projects.

Remember to document your extension and publish it to platforms like PyPI to make it accessible to the wider FastAPI community. Happy coding!
