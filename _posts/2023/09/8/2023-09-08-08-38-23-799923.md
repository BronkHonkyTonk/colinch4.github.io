In data analysis and time series analysis, it is often necessary to generate statistics data aggregated at different time intervals like months, weeks, and years. Python's datetime module provides powerful functionalities to manipulate dates and times, allowing us to easily generate such statistics data. In this blog post, we will explore how to generate monthly, weekly, and yearly statistics data using Python datetime.

## Generating Monthly Statistics Data

To generate monthly statistics data, we need to group our data based on the month of the date. Python's datetime module provides the `date.month` attribute to extract the month from a given date. We can use this attribute to group our data by month and calculate the desired statistics. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this process:

```python
import datetime

# Example data
data = [
    {"date": datetime.date(2022, 1, 1), "value": 10},
    {"date": datetime.date(2022, 1, 15), "value": 5},
    {"date": datetime.date(2022, 2, 1), "value": 8},
    {"date": datetime.date(2022, 2, 20), "value": 12},
]

# Group data by month
monthly_statistics = {}
for item in data:
    month = item["date"].month
    if month not in monthly_statistics:
        monthly_statistics[month] = []
    monthly_statistics[month].append(item["value"])

# Calculate statistics for each month
for month, values in monthly_statistics.items():
    print(f"Month: {month}")
    print(f"Total: {sum(values)}")
    print(f"Average: {sum(values) / len(values)}")
    print(f"Max: {max(values)}")
    print(f"Min: {min(values)}")
    print()
```

## Generating Weekly Statistics Data

Similarly, to generate weekly statistics data, we need to group our data based on the week of the date. Python's datetime module provides the `date.isocalendar()[1]` attribute to extract the week number from a given date. We can use this attribute to group our data by week and calculate the desired statistics. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this process:

```python
import datetime

# Example data
data = [
    {"date": datetime.date(2022, 1, 1), "value": 10},
    {"date": datetime.date(2022, 1, 9), "value": 5},
    {"date": datetime.date(2022, 1, 13), "value": 8},
    {"date": datetime.date(2022, 1, 22), "value": 12},
]

# Group data by week
weekly_statistics = {}
for item in data:
    week = item["date"].isocalendar()[1]
    if week not in weekly_statistics:
        weekly_statistics[week] = []
    weekly_statistics[week].append(item["value"])

# Calculate statistics for each week
for week, values in weekly_statistics.items():
    print(f"Week: {week}")
    print(f"Total: {sum(values)}")
    print(f"Average: {sum(values) / len(values)}")
    print(f"Max: {max(values)}")
    print(f"Min: {min(values)}")
    print()
```

## Generating Yearly Statistics Data

To generate yearly statistics data, we can again use the `date.year` attribute from Python's datetime module to group our data by year. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this process:

```python
import datetime

# Example data
data = [
    {"date": datetime.date(2020, 1, 1), "value": 10},
    {"date": datetime.date(2020, 2, 1), "value": 5},
    {"date": datetime.date(2021, 1, 1), "value": 8},
    {"date": datetime.date(2021, 2, 1), "value": 12},
]

# Group data by year
yearly_statistics = {}
for item in data:
    year = item["date"].year
    if year not in yearly_statistics:
        yearly_statistics[year] = []
    yearly_statistics[year].append(item["value"])

# Calculate statistics for each year
for year, values in yearly_statistics.items():
    print(f"Year: {year}")
    print(f"Total: {sum(values)}")
    print(f"Average: {sum(values) / len(values)}")
    print(f"Max: {max(values)}")
    print(f"Min: {min(values)}")
    print()
```

## Conclusion

Python's datetime module provides convenient functionalities for generating statistics data at different time intervals. By leveraging attributes like `date.month`, `date.isocalendar()[1]`, and `date.year`, we can easily group our data and calculate the desired statistics for months, weeks, and years. This capability is essential when analyzing time series data and can greatly simplify the data analysis process.
