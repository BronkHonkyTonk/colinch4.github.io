mpmath is a powerful library in Python for mathematical computations with arbitrary precision. In this blog post, we will explore how to work with infinite series and continued fractions using mpmath.

## Infinite Series

An infinite series is the sum of an infinite number of terms. mpmath allows us to compute infinite series with high precision. Let's consider the example of the harmonic series, which is defined as:

```
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ...
```

Using mpmath, we can calculate the sum of this series to a specific precision:

```python
import mpmath

mpmath.mp.dps = 50  # Set the precision

sum = mpmath.nsum(lambda n: 1 / n, [1, mpmath.inf])
print(sum)
```

In the above code, `dps` sets the decimal precision of the computation, and `nsum` is used to sum the series. We pass a lambda function as the first argument, where `n` represents the index of the term in the series. `[1, mpmath.inf]` is used to specify the range of indices.

## Continued Fractions

A continued fraction is an expression that represents a number as a sequence of nested fractions. mpmath provides a convenient way to work with continued fractions. Let's calculate the value of the golden ratio using continued fractions:

```python
import mpmath

mpmath.mp.dps = 50  # Set the precision

golden_ratio = mpmath.phi
print(golden_ratio)
```

In the above code, `phi` is a constant in mpmath that represents the golden ratio. We set the precision using `dps` and then simply print the value of the golden ratio using `print`.

mpmath makes it easy to work with mathematical concepts such as infinite series and continued fractions in Python. It provides high-precision calculations, allowing us to obtain accurate results in our computations.

In conclusion, mpmath enables us to work with infinite series and continued fractions with ease and accuracy in Python. It's a valuable tool for any mathematical computation that requires precision.
