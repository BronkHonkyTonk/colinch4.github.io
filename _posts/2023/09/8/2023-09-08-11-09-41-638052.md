CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are commonly used to store tabular data. Reading CSV files in Python is a common task in data analysis and data manipulation. In this blog post, we will explore how to read CSV files in Python using the `csv` module.

## **Importing the csv module**

First, we need to import the `csv` module in order to work with CSV files. The `csv` module is a built-in module in Python, so we don't need to install any external libraries.

```python
import csv
```

## **Reading CSV file**

To read a CSV file, we need to open it and create a reader object using the `csv.reader()` method. We can then iterate over the rows of the CSV file using a `for` loop.

```python
# Open the CSV file
with open('example.csv', 'r') as file:
    # Create a reader object
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    
    # Iterate over each row
    for row in reader:
        print(row)  # Print each row
```

In the code above, we used the `open()` function to open the CSV file in read mode (`'r'`). We then passed the file object to the `csv.reader()` method to create a reader object. The reader object allows us to iterate over the rows of the CSV file.

## **Accessing CSV data**

By default, each row in the CSV file is returned as a list of strings. We can access individual columns in a row by indexing the list.

```python
# Accessing specific columns
for row in reader:
    print(row[0])  # Access the first column
    print(row[1])  # Access the second column
```

In the code above, we access the first column of each row using `row[0]`, and the second column using `row[1]`.

## **Using delimiter and quotechar**

By default, the `csv.reader()` method treats commas as the delimiter and double quotes (`"`) as the quote character. However, we can specify custom delimiters and quote characters if our CSV file follows a different format.

```python
# Using custom delimiter and quote character
with open('example.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter=';', quotechar="'")
    
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

In the code above, we created a reader object with a semicolon (`;`) as the delimiter and a single quote (`'`) as the quote character.

## **Conclusion**

Reading CSV files in Python is a straightforward process using the `csv` module. We can open the CSV file, create a reader object, and iterate over the rows to access the data. We can also specify custom delimiters and quote characters if required. The `csv` module provides various other operations for reading and writing CSV files, including writing CSV data and handling header rows.
