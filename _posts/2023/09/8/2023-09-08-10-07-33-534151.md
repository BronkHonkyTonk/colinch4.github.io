Airflow is an open-source platform used to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It has a powerful REST API that allows users to interact with Airflow programmatically, performing various operations such as creating DAGs, triggering tasks, and monitoring task statuses. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the Airflow REST API in Python.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with the examples in this blog post, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

You should also have an Airflow instance set up and running.

## Installing Dependencies

First, let's start by installing the necessary dependencies. We will be using the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the Airflow REST API.

```python
pip install requests
```

## Making API Requests

To interact with the Airflow REST API, we need to make HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints. The Airflow REST API documentation provides a comprehensive list of available endpoints and their functions. In this blog post, we will focus on a few common operations: creating a DAG, triggering a task, and getting the status of a task.

### Creating a DAG

To create a new DAG using the Airflow REST API, we need to send a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/dags` endpoint. We need to provide the necessary information in the request body, such as the DAG ID, description, and the Python script containing the DAG definition. Here's an example:

```python
import requests

def create_dag():
    url = "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dags"
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    data = {
        "dag_id": "my_dag",
        "description": "My first Airflow DAG",
        "fileloc": "/path/to/my_dag.py"
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("DAG created successfully!")
    else:
        print("Failed to create DAG.")
```

### Triggering a Task

To trigger a task within a DAG, we need to send a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/dags/{dag_id}/dagRuns` endpoint. We need to provide the DAG ID and the task ID in the request body. Here's an example:

```python
import requests

def trigger_task():
    url = "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dags/my_dag/dagRuns"
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    data = {
        "task_id": "my_task"
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Task triggered successfully!")
    else:
        print("Failed to trigger task.")
```

### Getting Task Status

To get the status of a task in a DAG, we need to send a `GET` request to the `/api/v1/dags/{dag_id}/dagRuns/{dag_run_id}` endpoint. We need to provide the DAG ID and the DAG run ID in the request URL. Here's an example:

```python
import requests

def get_task_status():
    url = "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dags/my_dag/dagRuns/2019-01-01T00:00:00"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        status = data["state"]
        print(f"Task status: {status}")
    else:
        print("Failed to get task status.")
```

## Conclusion

Using the Airflow REST API, we can extend the functionality of Airflow by interacting with it programmatically. We explored how to create a DAG, trigger a task, and get the status of a task using Python. With these examples as a starting point, you can now leverage the Airflow REST API to automate and monitor your workflows effectively.
