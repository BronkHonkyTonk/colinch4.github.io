In scientific computing and mathematics, working with vectors is a common requirement. Sympy, a powerful Python library, provides a convenient way to handle vectors and perform vector operations.

Let's explore some of the basic vector operations that sympy offers.

## Creating vectors

To create a vector in sympy, we need to import the `Matrix` class from sympy. Here's an example of how to create a vector:

```python
from sympy import Matrix

# Create a vector using the Matrix class
vector = Matrix([1, 2, 3])

print(vector)  # Output: Matrix([[1], [2], [3]])
```

In the above example, we created a 3-dimensional vector `[1, 2, 3]`.

## Vector Addition and Subtraction

Sympy allows us to perform addition and subtraction operations on vectors just like regular arithmetic operations. Here's an example:

```python
from sympy import Matrix

# Create two vectors
vector1 = Matrix([1, 2, 3])
vector2 = Matrix([4, 5, 6])

# Perform vector addition
result_add = vector1 + vector2

# Perform vector subtraction
result_sub = vector1 - vector2

print(result_add)  # Output: Matrix([[5], [7], [9]])
print(result_sub)  # Output: Matrix([[-3], [-3], [-3]])
```

In the above example, we created two vectors `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]`. We performed vector addition and subtraction operations and printed the results.

## Vector Multiplication

In addition to addition and subtraction, Sympy allows us to perform various multiplication operations on vectors. Here are a few examples:

```python
from sympy import Matrix

# Create a vector and a scalar
vector = Matrix([1, 2, 3])
scalar = 2

# Multiply vector by a scalar
result_scalar_mult = scalar * vector

# Perform dot product of vectors
result_dot_product = vector.dot(vector)

print(result_scalar_mult)    # Output: Matrix([[2], [4], [6]])
print(result_dot_product)    # Output: 14
```

In the above example, we created a vector `[1, 2, 3]` and a scalar `2`. We performed scalar multiplication of the vector and calculated the dot product of the vector with itself.

These are just a few of the operations that sympy provides for handling vectors. Sympy also supports cross product, vector normalization, projection, and many other vector operations.

Sympy makes vector operations easy and convenient in Python, enabling efficient and accurate computations in various scientific disciplines.
