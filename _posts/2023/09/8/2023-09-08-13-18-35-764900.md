In this blog post, we will explore how to use regular expressions (regex) to validate the complexity of a password in Python. Regex allows us to define specific patterns that a string should match, making it an ideal tool for password validation.

## Password Complexity Requirements

Before we dive into the code, let's define the password complexity requirements that we want to enforce:

1. The password must be at least 8 characters long.
2. It must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.
3. It can include special characters, but they are not required.

## Using Regex to Validate Password Complexity

To validate the complexity of a password using regex in Python, we'll use the `re` module. Here is an example implementation:

```python
import re

def validate_password(password):
    # Regex pattern for password complexity
    pattern = r"^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z]).{8,}$"
    
    # Check if the password matches the pattern
    if re.match(pattern, password):
        print("Password is valid")
    else:
        print("Password is invalid")

# Test the function
password1 = "Passw0rd"
password2 = "weakpassword"

validate_password(password1)  # Output: Password is valid
validate_password(password2)  # Output: Password is invalid
```

In the above code, we define a regex pattern `^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z]).{8,}$` that enforces all the required complexity rules.

Let's break down this pattern:

- `^` asserts the start of the string.
- `(?=.*\d)` checks if there is at least one digit.
- `(?=.*[a-z])` checks if there is at least one lowercase letter.
- `(?=.*[A-Z])` checks if there is at least one uppercase letter.
- `.{8,}` ensures that the password is at least 8 characters long.
- `$` asserts the end of the string.

If the password matches the pattern, the function will output "Password is valid", otherwise it will output "Password is invalid".

Feel free to modify the regex pattern to enforce different complexity requirements according to your specific needs.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to use regex in Python to validate the complexity of a password. By defining a regex pattern that enforces specific rules, we can ensure that passwords meet the desired complexity requirements.

Regex provides a flexible and powerful way to validate strings and can be adapted to various use cases beyond password complexity validation. Make sure to explore the `re` module documentation to discover even more possibilities.
