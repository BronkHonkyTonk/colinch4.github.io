In Python, the `functools` module provides many useful functions for working with functions and callable objects. One such function is `cached_property`, which can be used to create a **cached property** in a class.

## What is a cached property?

A cached property is a computed attribute value that is computed only once and then stored for future access. Subsequent accesses to the property return the cached value instead of re-computing it.

This can be useful in situations where the computation of a property value is expensive and doesn't change frequently. By caching the result, we can save computational resources and improve the overall performance of our program.

## Using `functools.cached_property`

To use `functools.cached_property`, you'll need to import it from the `functools` module. Let's look at an example of how to use it:

```python
from functools import cached_property

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    @cached_property
    def area(self):
        print("Computing area...")
        return 3.14 * self.radius**2
```

In the example above, we have a `Circle` class with a `radius` attribute and a `cached_property` called `area`. The `area` property is computed using the formula πr², where `r` is the radius of the circle.

The first time we access the `area` property, it will compute the area and cache the result. Subsequent accesses to the property will return the cached value.

Here's an example usage of the `Circle` class:

```python
circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.area)  # Will compute and cache the area
print(circle.area)  # Will return the cached area
```

Output:
```
Computing area...
78.5
78.5
```

As you can see, the `area` property is only computed once, even though we accessed it twice. The second time, the cached value is returned immediately.

## Benefits of using `functools.cached_property`

Using `functools.cached_property` can bring several advantages to your code:

1. Improved Performance: By caching the computed result, you avoid redundant computation, leading to improved performance, especially in cases where the computation is expensive.

2. Clearer Code: The use of `cached_property` makes it clear to other developers that the property value is cached and not calculated on each access. This can help improve code readability and maintainability.

3. Flexibility: With `cached_property`, you have the flexibility to define more complex property calculations without worrying about repeated computation. You can focus on the logic and let `cached_property` handle the caching.

## Conclusion

The `functools.cached_property` function in Python's `functools` module provides a convenient way to create cached properties in your classes. By using it, you can improve the performance of your code by avoiding unnecessary computations.
