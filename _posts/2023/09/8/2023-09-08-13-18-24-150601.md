In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `sympy` library in Python to work with polar coordinates and Euler's equations.

## Polar Coordinates with sympy

Polar coordinates are a way of representing points in a plane using a distance from a fixed point (called the origin) and an angle from a fixed direction. `sympy` provides a `Point` class that makes it easy to work with polar coordinates.

To start, let's import the necessary modules:

```python
import sympy as sp
```

Now, let's create a point in polar coordinates:

```python
p = sp.Point(sp.sqrt(2), sp.pi/4)
```

Here, `sqrt(2)` represents the distance from the origin and `pi/4` represents the angle in radians.

To convert this point to Cartesian coordinates, we can use the `coordinates` method:

```python
x, y = p.coordinates('xy')
```

This will give us the values of `x` and `y` in Cartesian coordinates.

## Euler's Equations with sympy

Euler's equations are a set of differential equations that describe the motion of a rigid body under the influence of external forces. `sympy` provides a `mechanics` module that includes functions to work with Euler's equations.

To get started, let's import the necessary modules:

```python
import sympy.physics.mechanics as mech
```

Next, we need to define the symbols for the variables in the equations:

```python
theta = mech.dynamicsymbols('theta')
omega = mech.dynamicsymbols('omega')
```

Now, let's define the body and its properties:

```python
body = mech.RigidBody('Body', mech.Point('O'), mech.ReferenceFrame('N'))
```

We can add the inertia of the body using the `inertia` method:

```python
inertia = (mech.ReferenceFrame('N'), sp.Matrix([[I, 0, 0], [0, I, 0], [0, 0, I]]))
body.set_inertia(inertia)
```

Finally, we can define the external forces acting on the body using the `Gravity` class:

```python
g = mech.Gravity('g')
forces = [(mech.Point('O'), -m * g)]
body.apply_external_forces(forces)
```

We can now use the `LagrangesMethod` function to derive the equations of motion:

```python
lagrange = mech.LagrangesMethod(mech.LagrangesMethod(mech.Lagrangian(body, theta, omega), [theta], [omega]))
equations = lagrange.form_lagranges_equations()
```

The resulting `equations` object will contain the equations of motion for the body.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have seen how to use `sympy` to work with polar coordinates and solve Euler's equations. `sympy` provides a powerful and convenient way to perform mathematical computations in Python. By using the `Point` and `RigidBody` classes, we can easily manipulate polar coordinates and derive equations of motion.
