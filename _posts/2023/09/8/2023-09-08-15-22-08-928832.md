In Python, the `functools` module provides various decorators that can be used to modify the behavior of functions. These decorators can be applied in a specific order to achieve specific functionality. In this blog post, we will discuss the order of applying `functools` decorators and provide examples for each step.

## Step 1: `wraps()` decorator

The `wraps()` decorator from the `functools` module is used to preserve the metadata of the original function when creating a decorator. It copies the attributes such as `__name__`, `__module__`, `__doc__`, etc. from the original function to the decorator function.

```python
from functools import wraps

def decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Perform additional tasks before calling the original function
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # Perform additional tasks after calling the original function
        return result
    return wrapper
```

## Step 2: `lru_cache()` decorator

The `lru_cache()` decorator is used for caching the results of a function call, with the least recently used entries discarded when the cache exceeds a certain size.

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@decorator
@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def my_function(arg):
    # Perform some computation
    return result
```

## Step 3: `partial()` decorator

The `partial()` function from the `functools` module is used to create a new function with some of the arguments pre-filled. It allows us to create simplified versions of functions with default arguments.

```python
from functools import partial

@decorator
@partial(my_function, arg='default value')
def my_partial_function():
    # Perform some computation using the pre-filled argument
    return result
```

## Step 4: `singledispatch()` decorator

The `singledispatch()` decorator is used to define a generic function that can have different implementations based on the type of the argument. It is particularly useful when implementing polymorphic behavior.

```python
from functools import singledispatch

@singledispatch
@decorator
def my_generic_function(arg):
    # Perform some computation based on the type of argument
    return result
```

## Step 5: `total_ordering()` decorator

The `total_ordering()` decorator is used to automatically generate missing comparison methods (`__eq__()`, `__ne__()`, `__lt__()`, `__gt__()`, etc.) for a class based on a minimal set of comparison methods.

```python
from functools import total_ordering

@decorator
@total_ordering
class MyComparableClass:
    def __eq__(self, other):
        # Comparison logic for equality
        pass
    
    def __lt__(self, other):
        # Comparison logic for less than
        pass
```

These steps provide a general guide for applying `functools` decorators in a specific order based on the desired functionality. By following this order, you can effectively enhance the behavior of your Python functions and classes.

Remember to `import functools` to access the functionalities provided by the `functools` module.

*Note: The order of decorators in the examples is for illustrative purposes and can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your code.*
