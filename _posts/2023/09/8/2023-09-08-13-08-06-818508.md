[SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) is a powerful Python library for symbolic mathematics. It provides a wide range of features for symbolically manipulating mathematical expressions. In this blog post, we will explore how to create symbolic expressions in SymPy from strings.

## 문제

Imagine you have a string representation of a mathematical expression and you want to convert it into a symbolic expression in SymPy. For example, suppose you have the following string: `"2*x + 3*y - 4*z"`.

## 해결

To create a symbolic expression from a string in SymPy, we need to use the `sympify` function. This function takes a string representation of a mathematical expression as input and returns a corresponding SymPy expression.

Here is an example of how to use the `sympify` function to create symbolic expressions from strings:

```python
from sympy import sympify, symbols

# Define the variables
x, y, z = symbols('x y z')

# String representation of the expression
expr_str = "2*x + 3*y - 4*z"

# Create the symbolic expression
expr = sympify(expr_str)

# Print the symbolic expression
print(expr)
```

Running this code will output: `2*x + 3*y - 4*z`, which is the symbolic expression created from the string.

## 결과

By using the `sympify` function in SymPy, we can easily create symbolic expressions from strings. This can be useful when dealing with user input or when working with expressions stored in external files or databases.

Whether you are solving equations, simplifying expressions, or performing other symbolic computations, SymPy provides a convenient way to work with symbolic expressions in Python.
