mpmath is a Python library that provides arbitrary-precision arithmetic and mathematical functions. In this blog post, we will explore how to use mpmath to calculate various statistical distributions and their probability density functions (PDFs).

## Installing mpmath

Before we begin, make sure you have mpmath installed. You can install it using pip:

```
$ pip install mpmath
```

Once installed, we can import mpmath in our Python script or notebook:

```python
import mpmath
```

## Normal Distribution

The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a continuous probability distribution defined by its mean and standard deviation. The PDF of the normal distribution is defined as:

```
f(x) = (1 / (sqrt(2π) * σ)) * exp(-(x - μ)^2 / (2σ^2))
```

where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.

To calculate the PDF of the normal distribution using mpmath, we can use the `mpmath.normpdf` function:

```python
import mpmath

x = 1.5
mu = 0.0
sigma = 1.0

pdf = mpmath.normpdf(x, mu, sigma)
```

## Uniform Distribution

The uniform distribution is a continuous probability distribution where all values within a specified interval are equally likely. The PDF of the uniform distribution is defined as:

```
f(x) = 1 / (b - a) if a <= x <= b
```

where a and b are the lower and upper bounds of the interval.

To calculate the PDF of the uniform distribution using mpmath, we can use the `mpmath.uniformpdf` function:

```python
import mpmath

x = 0.5
a = 0.0
b = 1.0

pdf = mpmath.uniformpdf(x, a, b)
```

## Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that models the time between events in a Poisson process. The PDF of the exponential distribution is defined as:

```
f(x) = λ * exp(-λ * x)
```

where λ is the rate parameter.

To calculate the PDF of the exponential distribution using mpmath, we can use the `mpmath.exppdf` function:

```python
import mpmath

x = 1.5
rate = 2.0

pdf = mpmath.exppdf(x, rate)
```
