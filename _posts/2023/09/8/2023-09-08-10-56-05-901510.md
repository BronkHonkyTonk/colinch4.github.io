In this blog post, I will demonstrate how to perform encryption and decryption using the PyCrypto library in Python. Specifically, I will focus on 3DES and Blowfish encryption algorithms.

## Installation

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the PyCrypto library installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:

```python
pip install pycrypto
```

## 3DES Encryption

Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) is a symmetric encryption algorithm that applies the DES algorithm three times to each data block. Let's see how we can use PyCrypto to encrypt and decrypt data using 3DES.

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import DES3

def encrypt_3des(key, plaintext):
    cipher = DES3.new(key, DES3.MODE_ECB)
    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext)
    return ciphertext

def decrypt_3des(key, ciphertext):
    cipher = DES3.new(key, DES3.MODE_ECB)
    plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
    return plaintext

# Example usage
key = b'0123456789abcdef'
plaintext = b'Hello, World!'

encrypted_text = encrypt_3des(key, plaintext)
decrypted_text = decrypt_3des(key, encrypted_text)

print("Encrypted text:", encrypted_text)
print("Decrypted text:", decrypted_text)
```

Make sure to replace the `key` and `plaintext` variables with your own values. The `encrypt_3des()` function takes a key and plain text as input and returns the encrypted text. The `decrypt_3des()` function takes a key and encrypted text as input and returns the decrypted text.

## Blowfish Encryption

Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks and supports key sizes between 32 and 448 bits. Let's see how we can use PyCrypto to encrypt and decrypt data using Blowfish.

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish

def encrypt_blowfish(key, plaintext):
    cipher = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_ECB)
    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext)
    return ciphertext

def decrypt_blowfish(key, ciphertext):
    cipher = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_ECB)
    plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
    return plaintext

# Example usage
key = b'mypassword'
plaintext = b'Hello, World!'

encrypted_text = encrypt_blowfish(key, plaintext)
decrypted_text = decrypt_blowfish(key, encrypted_text)

print("Encrypted text:", encrypted_text)
print("Decrypted text:", decrypted_text)
```

Replace the `key` and `plaintext` variables with your own values. The `encrypt_blowfish()` function takes a key and plain text as input and returns the encrypted text. The `decrypt_blowfish()` function takes a key and encrypted text as input and returns the decrypted text.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to use the PyCrypto library to perform 3DES and Blowfish encryption in Python. Encryption is a crucial aspect of data security, and by utilizing these algorithms, you can ensure the confidentiality of your sensitive information. Remember to handle keys securely and keep them confidential.
