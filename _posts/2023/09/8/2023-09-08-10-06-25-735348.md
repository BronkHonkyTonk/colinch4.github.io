In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `boto3` library in Python to interact with AWS Elemental MediaPackage for content packaging.

**AWS Elemental MediaPackage** is a video origination and packaging service that lets you securely and reliably prepare and deliver streaming content at scale. It supports the packaging and encryption of live and on-demand video assets for delivery to various devices.

**Boto3** is the official AWS SDK for Python, which allows developers to interact with AWS services using Python code. With boto3, you can programmatically access and manage AWS resources without the need for manual intervention.

So, let's dive into an example code that demonstrates how to use `boto3` to package content using AWS Elemental MediaPackage.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine.
2. [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured with your AWS credentials.
3. [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html) library installed.

## Example Code

First, let's install the `boto3` library by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

Next, import the required modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_AWS_REGION'
)
```

Now, create a MediaPackage client using the session:

```python
mediapackage = session.client('mediapackage')
```

Let's assume you have already configured the necessary inputs for content packaging, such as the channel ID, source URL, and output configuration. You can now create a new endpoint for content packaging:

```python
response = mediapackage.create_endpoint(
    Id='my-endpoint',
    ChannelId='my-channel',
    HlsPackage={
        'Encryption': {
            'SpekeKeyProvider': {
                'RoleArn': 'arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/my-role',
                'ResourceId': 'my-speke-resource',
                'SystemIds': [
                    'SPECIFY_YOUR_SYSTEM_ID'
                ]
            }
        },
        'StreamSelection': {
            'MaxVideoBitsPerSecond': 'SPECIFY_MAX_BITRATE',
            'MinVideoBitsPerSecond': 'SPECIFY_MIN_BITRATE'
        },
        'ManifestWindowSeconds': 60
    }
)
```

The above code snippet creates a new endpoint with the specified `Id` and `ChannelId`. It also sets up encryption using the `SpekeKeyProvider` and defines the desired video bitrate range.

You can now check the response from the API and verify if the endpoint was created successfully:

```python
if response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode'] == 200:
    print('Endpoint created successfully!')
else:
    print('Failed to create endpoint.')
```

Now you have successfully created an endpoint for content packaging using AWS Elemental MediaPackage!

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to use the `boto3` library in Python to interact with AWS Elemental MediaPackage for content packaging. We covered the necessary prerequisites, installed the required dependencies, and provided an example code snippet for creating a new endpoint.

AWS Elemental MediaPackage offers a wide range of features for preparing and delivering streaming content. By leveraging the capabilities of `boto3`, you can easily automate the process of content packaging and integrate it into your existing workflows.

I hope you found this blog post helpful in understanding how to use `boto3` for content packaging with AWS Elemental MediaPackage. Thank you for reading!
