In python, the `pathlib` module provides an object-oriented approach to working with filesystem paths. Along with its powerful path manipulation abilities, it also offers several methods for validating paths and files.

## Checking if a Path Exists

To check if a path exists, you can use the `exists()` method provided by the `Path` class. This method returns `True` if the path exists, and `False` otherwise.

```python
from pathlib import Path

path = Path("/path/to/file.txt")

if path.exists():
    print("Path exists")
else:
    print("Path does not exist")
```

## Checking if a Path is a File or a Directory

To determine whether a path points to a file or a directory, you can use the `is_file()` and `is_dir()` methods respectively.

```python
from pathlib import Path

path = Path("/path/to/file.txt")

if path.is_file():
    print("Path is a file")
elif path.is_dir():
    print("Path is a directory")
else:
    print("Path does not exist")
```

## Checking File Extension

To check the file extension of a path, you can utilize the `suffix` attribute of the `Path` object. This attribute returns the file extension including the dot (`.`).

```python
from pathlib import Path

path = Path("/path/to/file.txt")

if path.suffix == ".txt":
    print("File has a .txt extension")
else:
    print("File does not have a .txt extension")
```

## Checking File Size

To check the size of a file, you can use the `stat()` method of the `Path` object to obtain file statistics. From the statistics, you can access the `st_size` attribute to get the file size in bytes.

```python
from pathlib import Path

path = Path("/path/to/file.txt")

if path.is_file():
    file_size = path.stat().st_size
    print(f"File size: {file_size} bytes")
else:
    print("Path does not point to a file")
```

These are some of the ways you can use the `pathlib` module in python to validate paths and files. By leveraging the methods and attributes provided by this module, you can perform various checks and ensure the correctness of your file and directory paths in your python applications.
