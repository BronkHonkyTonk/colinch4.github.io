Apache Airflow is a popular open-source tool used for orchestrating complex data workflows. It provides a powerful templating engine called Jinja that allows you to dynamically generate code or configuration files.

In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage Airflow Jinja templates to make our Python code more dynamic and reusable.

## What is Jinja?

[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) is a Python-based templating engine that allows you to generate dynamic text output. It provides syntax for variables, loops, conditionals, and more. Jinja is widely used in web development frameworks like Flask and Django.

## Why use Jinja with Airflow?

Airflow uses Jinja templates to parameterize tasks and generate dynamic code. With Jinja, you can easily customize task parameters based on the context in which the workflow is executed. This makes your code more flexible and reusable.

## Using Jinja templates in Airflow

To use Jinja templates in Airflow, you need to enclose your template variables or expressions within curly braces `{}`. Let's take a look at some examples.

### Example 1: Passing parameters to a SQL query

Let's say you have a SQL task that requires dynamic values for table name and date range. You can use Jinja templates to pass these parameters at runtime.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators import MySQLOperator

dag = DAG('example_dag', ...)

table_name = 'my_table'
start_date = '2022-01-01'
end_date = '2022-01-07'

sql_task = MySQLOperator(
    task_id='sql_task',
    sql=f"SELECT * FROM `{table_name}` WHERE date BETWEEN '{start_date}' AND '{end_date}'",
    dag=dag
)
```

In the above example, we use Jinja templates to dynamically insert the table name and date range into the SQL query.

### Example 2: Using conditionals in task parameters

Jinja allows you to use conditionals to control the behavior of your tasks. Let's consider an example where you want to send an email notification only if a certain condition is met.

```python
{% raw %}
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators import EmailOperator

dag = DAG('example_dag', ...)

task_result = SomeOperator(task_id='some_task', dag=dag)

send_email = EmailOperator(
    task_id='send_email',
    to='email@example.com',
    subject='Task completed',
    html_content='{% if task_result == "success" %}The task succeeded.{% else %}The task failed.{% endif %}',
    dag=dag
)
{% endraw %}
```

In this example, the `html_content` parameter of the `EmailOperator` uses Jinja's conditional syntax to conditionally construct the email content based on the result of the previous task.

## Conclusion

Jinja templates bring tremendous flexibility to your Airflow workflows. By leveraging the power of Jinja, you can make your code more dynamic, reusable, and easy to maintain. Whether you need to pass parameters to SQL queries, use conditionals in task parameters, or generate dynamic content, Jinja templates in Airflow have got you covered.
