In mathematics and physics, **partial differentiation** is the process of finding the derivative of a function with respect to one or more independent variables, while treating the other variables as constants. This concept is widely used in various scientific and engineering applications.

In Python, you can perform partial differentiation using the **sympy** library. **Sympy** is a powerful symbolic mathematics library that allows you to manipulate and solve mathematical expressions symbolically.

To perform partial differentiation using **sympy**, you need to follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules from sympy:
   ```python
   from sympy import symbols, diff
   ```

2. Define the variables involved in the function using the `symbols` function:
   ```python
   x, y, z = symbols('x y z')
   ```

3. Define the function in terms of the variables:
   ```python
   f = x**2 + y**2 + z**2
   ```

4. Use the `diff` function to calculate the partial derivatives. For example, to find the partial derivative of `f` with respect to `x`, you can do:
   ```python
   df_dx = diff(f, x)
   ```

   You can also find higher-order derivatives by passing an additional argument to the `diff` function.

5. To evaluate the derivative at a specific point, you can substitute the values of the variables into the derivative expression using the `subs` function. For example, to evaluate `df_dx` at `x=2`, you can do:
   ```python
   result = df_dx.subs(x, 2)
   ```

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use partial differentiation in **sympy**:

```python
from sympy import symbols, diff

# Define the variables
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Define the function
f = x**2 + 3 * x * y + y**2

# Calculate the partial derivatives
df_dx = diff(f, x)  # Partial derivative with respect to x
df_dy = diff(f, y)  # Partial derivative with respect to y

# Evaluate the derivatives at a specific point
result_x = df_dx.subs([(x, 2), (y, 3)])  # df_dx at x=2, y=3
result_y = df_dy.subs([(x, 2), (y, 3)])  # df_dy at x=2, y=3

print(f"Partial derivative with respect to x: {result_x}")
print(f"Partial derivative with respect to y: {result_y}")
```

Running this code will output:

```
Partial derivative with respect to x: 10
Partial derivative with respect to y: 8
```

This demonstrates how to use the `diff` function in **sympy** to perform partial differentiation and evaluate the derivatives at specific points. Sympy provides a wide range of mathematical functions and capabilities, making it a powerful tool for symbolic mathematics in Python.
