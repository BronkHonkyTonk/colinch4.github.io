If you need to perform **symbolic differentiation** or **numerical integration** with high precision in Python, the **mpmath** library is a powerful tool that can help you achieve accurate results.

## Installing mpmath

To get started, you need to install mpmath. You can install it using pip by running the following command:

```python
pip install mpmath
```

## Symbolic Differentiation in mpmath

```
import mpmath

# Define the variables
x = mpmath.Symbol('x')
y = mpmath.Symbol('y')

# Define the function
f = mpmath.cos(x) * mpmath.sin(x) ** 2

# Differentiate the function
df_dx = mpmath.diff(f, x)
df_dy = mpmath.diff(f, y)

# Print the results
print("df/dx =", df_dx)
print("df/dy =", df_dy)
```

In the above code, we first define the variables `x` and `y`. Then, we define the function `f` which is the product of the cosine of `x` and the square of the sine of `x`. We use the `mpmath.diff` function to differentiate `f` with respect to `x` and `y`. Finally, we print the results.

## Numerical Integration in mpmath

```
import mpmath

# Define the function to integrate
def f(x):
    return mpmath.sin(x) / x

# Set the desired precision
mp.dps = 25

# Perform numerical integration
result, error = mpmath.quad(f, [0, 1])

# Print the result
print("Integral =", result)
print("Error =", error)
```

In the above code, we define a function `f` that represents the function to be integrated. We then set the desired precision using `mpmath.dps`. The `mpmath.quad` function is used to perform numerical integration, where the first argument is the function to be integrated and the second argument is the interval over which the integration is performed. Finally, we print the result and the error.

mpmath provides many other functions and capabilities for advanced mathematical calculations. I encourage you to explore the documentation to learn more about its features and how it can help you with your mathematical computations.
