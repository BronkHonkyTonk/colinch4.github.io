Python's `pickle` module provides a way to serialize and deserialize objects. It allows you to convert complex objects into a byte stream, which can be saved to a file or sent across a network. While `pickle` can handle most built-in objects, it also provides support for **custom object serialization**. This means you can define how your own classes should be converted into a byte stream.

In this blog post, I will demonstrate how to use `pickle` for custom object serialization in Python.

## Serializing Custom Objects with Pickle

To enable serialization with `pickle`, you need to implement two methods in your custom class: `__getstate__()` and `__setstate__()`. 

The `__getstate__()` method is responsible for collecting the object's state and returning it as a dictionary. This state will be serialized and saved to a file.

The `__setstate__()` method is responsible for restoring the object's state from the serialized data. It takes a dictionary as a parameter, representing the object's state, and should update the object's attributes accordingly.

Here's an example of a custom class called `Person` that implements these methods:

```python
import pickle

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def __getstate__(self):
        state = self.__dict__.copy()
        state['age'] += 10  # Modifying the age during serialization
        return state
    
    def __setstate__(self, state):
        state['age'] -= 10  # Modifying the age during deserialization
        self.__dict__ = state

# Create an instance of Person
person = Person("John Doe", 30)

# Serialize the object to a file
with open("person.pickle", "wb") as file:
    pickle.dump(person, file)
```

In this example, the `__getstate__()` method increments the age of the `Person` object by 10 before serialization. Similarly, the `__setstate__()` method decrements the age by 10 during deserialization.

## Deserializing Custom Objects with Pickle

To deserialize a custom object with `pickle`, you simply need to read the serialized data from a file and call `pickle.load()`.

Here's an example of how to deserialize the `Person` object we serialized in the previous example:

```python
import pickle

# Deserialize the object from the file
with open("person.pickle", "rb") as file:
    person = pickle.load(file)

# Print the deserialized object
print(person.name)  # Output: John Doe
print(person.age)   # Output: 40
```

In this example, we open the `"person.pickle"` file in binary mode and call `pickle.load()` to deserialize the object. We can then access the object's attributes as usual.

## Conclusion

Using `pickle`, we can easily serialize and deserialize custom objects in Python. By implementing the `__getstate__()` and `__setstate__()` methods in our custom classes, we have control over how the objects are serialized and deserialized. This gives us the flexibility to handle complex object structures and customize the serialization process.

Remember that **`pickle` should be used with caution** when dealing with untrusted data, as it can execute arbitrary code during deserialization.
