In probability theory and statistics, a continuous probability distribution represents the probabilities of the possible outcomes of a continuous random variable. The mpmath library in Python provides a powerful and flexible framework for working with various mathematical functions, including continuous probability distributions.

## The mpmath library

[mpmath](http://mpmath.org/) is a Python library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, numerical computing, and symbolic computation. It allows you to perform advanced mathematical calculations with a high degree of precision. One of its key features is the ability to work with various mathematical functions, including continuous probability distributions.

## Continuous probability distributions in mpmath

mpmath provides several continuous probability distributions, such as *uniform*, *normal*, *exponential*, *gamma*, *beta*, *cauchy*, and many more. These distributions are defined by their probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). You can use these functions to compute the probabilities and percentiles associated with specific values of the random variable.

Let's take a look at an example using the normal distribution in mpmath.

```python
import mpmath

# Set the precision for mpmath
mp.dps = 25

# Define the parameters of the normal distribution
mu = mpf(0)  # mean
sigma = mpf(1)  # standard deviation

# Compute the PDF and CDF for a specific value
x = mpf(-1.5)
pdf = mpmath.exp(-(x - mu)**2 / (2*sigma**2)) / (sigma * mpmath.sqrt(2*mpmath.pi))
cdf = 0.5 * (1 + mpmath.erf((x - mu) / (sigma * mpmath.sqrt(2))))

print(f"PDF: {pdf}")
print(f"CDF: {cdf}")
```

In this example, we use mpmath to compute the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a specific value (-1.5) from a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

## Conclusion

mpmath is a powerful library for working with various mathematical functions, including continuous probability distributions. By using mpmath, you can easily compute probabilities and percentiles associated with specific values of continuous random variables. Whether you need to analyze data or perform advanced mathematical calculations, mpmath provides a comprehensive framework for working with continuous probability distributions in Python.
