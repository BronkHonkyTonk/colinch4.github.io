## Introduction
Probability distributions play a crucial role in statistical analysis and machine learning. They help us understand the likelihood of different outcomes and make predictions based on data. In this blog post, we will explore how to work with continuous and discrete probability distributions using the `sympy` library in Python.

## What is `sympy`?
`sympy` is a powerful Python library for symbolic mathematics. It provides a wide range of mathematical functions and tools to solve and manipulate mathematical expressions. One of the key features of `sympy` is its support for probability distributions, both continuous and discrete.

## Continous Probability Distributions
A continuous probability distribution is a probability distribution for a continuous random variable. `sympy` provides various functions to work with continuous probability distributions, such as the normal distribution, exponential distribution, and uniform distribution.

### Example: Normal Distribution
The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most commonly used probability distributions. It is characterized by its bell-shaped curve.

```python
import sympy.stats as stats

# Define the random variable
X = stats.Normal('X', 0, 1)  # mean = 0, standard deviation = 1

# Calculate the probability density function (PDF)
pdf = stats.density(X).doit()

# Calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
cdf = stats.cdf(X).doit()

# Calculate the mean and variance of the distribution
mean = stats.mean(X)
variance = stats.variance(X)

# Generate random numbers from the distribution
random_nums = stats.rvs(X, size=100)
```

## Discrete Probability Distributions
A discrete probability distribution is a probability distribution for a discrete random variable. `sympy` provides functions to work with various discrete probability distributions, such as the binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, and geometric distribution.

### Example: Binomial Distribution
The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.

```python
import sympy.stats as stats

# Define the random variable
X = stats.Binomial('X', 10, 0.5)  # n = 10, p = 0.5

# Calculate the probability mass function (PMF)
pmf = stats.density(X).doit()

# Calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
cdf = stats.cdf(X).doit()

# Calculate the mean and variance of the distribution
mean = stats.mean(X)
variance = stats.variance(X)

# Generate random numbers from the distribution
random_nums = stats.rvs(X, size=100)
```

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we explored how to work with continuous and discrete probability distributions using the `sympy` library in Python. We learned how to calculate the probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), mean, variance, and generate random numbers from different probability distributions. Armed with this knowledge, you can now apply probability distributions to your statistical analysis and machine learning projects with ease.
