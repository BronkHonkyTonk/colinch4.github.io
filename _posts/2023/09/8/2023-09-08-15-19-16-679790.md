In Python, the `functools` module provides several functions to work with higher-order functions and callable objects. One useful function from this module is `partial()`. 

The `partial()` function allows you to create a new function with some of the arguments already filled in. It is particularly helpful when you have a function that requires a lot of parameters, but you want to fix some of them to specific values.

## Basic Usage

The `partial()` function works by **freezing** some arguments of an existing function and returning a new function with those arguments already set. Here is an example to illustrate its basic usage:

```python
from functools import partial

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

double = partial(multiply, y=2)  # Create a new function with y=2

print(double(5))  # Output: 10
```

In the above code, we have a `multiply()` function that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns their product. We use the `partial()` function to create a new function called `double` that has the `y` argument already set to `2`. When we call `double(5)`, it multiplies `5` by `2` and returns `10`.

## Application: Simplifying Callback Functions

One common use case of `partial()` is simplifying callback functions with fixed arguments. Consider the following example:

```python
from functools import partial

def process_item(item, callback):
    # Processing logic here
    processed_item = item.upper()
    
    # Invoke the callback function
    callback(processed_item)

def print_item(item):
    print(item)

items = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

# Process each item and print the processed item
for item in items:
    process_item(item, print_item)
```

In the code above, we have a function `process_item()` that takes an item and a callback function as arguments. It processes the item and then invokes the callback function with the processed item as an argument. We want to print each processed item by passing the `print_item()` function as the callback.

Instead of defining a new function `print_item()` separately, we can use `partial()` to simplify the code:

```python
from functools import partial

def process_item(item, callback):
    # Processing logic here
    processed_item = item.upper()
    
    # Invoke the callback function
    callback(processed_item)

items = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

# Process each item and print the processed item
for item in items:
    process_item(item, partial(print, end=' '))
```

In the modified code, we use `partial(print, end=' ')` to create a new function that behaves like `print()`, but with the `end` argument fixed to a space character `' '`. This way, we don't need to define a separate `print_item()` function and can directly pass `partial(print, end=' ')` as the callback.

## Conclusion

The `functools.partial()` function is a powerful tool in Python that allows you to create new functions with some arguments already filled in. It can simplify your code by reducing the need for defining separate functions or repeating similar code blocks. Next time you encounter a situation where you want to fix some arguments of a function, give `partial()` a try!
