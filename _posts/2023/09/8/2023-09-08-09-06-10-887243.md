In Django REST Framework (DRF), serializers play a crucial role in converting complex data types, such as models or querysets, into primitive data types, which can then be easily rendered into JSON/XML responses. 

One of the powerful features of DRF is the ability to nest serializers, allowing you to handle relationships between different models or related data structures. This is particularly useful when dealing with One-to-One, One-to-Many, or Many-to-Many relationships.

Let's dive into an example to understand how to use nested serializers in DRF.

## Example Scenario

Consider a scenario where we have two models: `Author` and `Book`. An `Author` can have multiple `Books`, and a `Book` belongs to an `Author`. We want to create APIs to fetch the details of an author along with all their books.

## Setting up the Models

First, let's define our models in the `models.py` file:

```python
from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    publication_date = models.DateField()
```

## Creating Serializers

Next, we need to define serializers for our models in the `serializers.py` file:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Author, Book

class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ['id', 'title', 'publication_date']

class AuthorSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)
    
    class Meta:
        model = Author
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'email', 'books']
```

Here, we define the `BookSerializer` with the appropriate fields we want to include. In the `AuthorSerializer`, we include a nested serializer `BookSerializer` to handle the books related to the author. By setting `many=True`, we indicate that an author can have multiple books.

## Configuring Views

Finally, we need to configure the views in the `views.py` file:

```python
from rest_framework import generics
from .serializers import AuthorSerializer
from .models import Author

class AuthorDetail(generics.RetrieveAPIView):
    queryset = Author.objects.all()
    serializer_class = AuthorSerializer
```

Here, we use the `RetrieveAPIView` class provided by DRF and specify the queryset and serializer_class.

## Testing the API

With everything set up, we can now test our API. Let's assume we have an author with an ID of 1 and two books related to that author.

When we make a GET request to the `/authors/1` endpoint, we would receive a response like this:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "books": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "Book 1",
            "publication_date": "2022-01-01"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "title": "Book 2",
            "publication_date": "2022-02-01"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Conclusion

DRF provides powerful tools, such as nested serializers, to handle complex data relationships in a straightforward manner. By properly defining and nesting serializers, you can easily fetch and display related data structures in your APIs. This allows you to create rich, structured responses that effectively represent the relationships between your models.
