In web development, file upload functionality is a common requirement for many applications. FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python, provides a simple and efficient way to handle file uploads.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement file upload functionality using FastAPI.

## Setup

First, make sure you have FastAPI installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```shell
$ pip install fastapi
```

FastAPI relies on [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for its data validation and serialization capabilities, so let's also install Pydantic:

```shell
$ pip install pydantic
```

## Creating an Upload API

Let's start by creating a FastAPI API endpoint that allows uploading files. Create a new Python file, `main.py`, and add the following code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    contents = await file.read()
    return {"filename": file.filename, "contents": contents}
```
In this code, we import the necessary modules from FastAPI and define the `/upload` endpoint as a **POST** HTTP method. The `UploadFile` class represents the uploaded file and is defined as a parameter with the `File(...)` declaration.

Inside the endpoint, we use `await file.read()` to read the contents of the uploaded file. We then return the file's metadata (`filename`) along with its contents.

## Testing the File Upload API

To test our file upload API, we'll create a simple HTML form that allows users to select a file and submit it to our endpoint.

Create a new HTML file, `index.html`, and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>File Upload</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>File Upload</h1>
    <form action="/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" name="file">
        <input type="submit" value="Upload">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

Save the `index.html` file in the same directory as `main.py`.

## Starting the FastAPI Server

To start the FastAPI server, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `main.py`, and run the following command:

```shell
$ uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Uploading a File

Visit `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your web browser. You should see a simple file upload form. Select a file to upload, and click the "Upload" button.

FastAPI will handle the file upload and return its metadata and contents as a JSON response:

```json
{
    "filename": "example.png",
    "contents": "<binary-data>"
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement file upload functionality using FastAPI in Python. We created an API endpoint that allows file uploads, tested it with a simple HTML form, and learned how to access the uploaded file's metadata and contents. FastAPI's simplicity and performance make it an excellent choice for building powerful web applications with file upload capabilities.

Remember, this is just the beginning of what you can achieve with FastAPI. You can further customize and extend the file upload functionality based on your specific requirements.
