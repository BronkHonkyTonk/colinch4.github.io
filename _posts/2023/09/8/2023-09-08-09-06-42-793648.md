FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. In addition to supporting RESTful endpoints, FastAPI also provides support for real-time communication using websockets. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement websocket communication using FastAPI.

## What are Websockets?

Websockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, allowing for real-time communication between a client and a server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests where the client initiates a request and the server responds, websockets enable bidirectional communication, where the server can send data to the client without the client explicitly requesting it.

## Setting Up FastAPI Websocket Server

To get started with FastAPI's websocket support, you will need to install the necessary packages. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard]
```

Next, let's create a new Python file called `main.py` and import the required libraries:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse

app = FastAPI()
```

Now, let's define a websocket route that will handle incoming websocket connections:

```python
@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    while True:
        data = await websocket.receive_text()
        await websocket.send_text(f"You wrote: {data}")
```

In the above code, we define the `/ws` route as a websocket endpoint. When a client connects to this route, the `websocket_endpoint` function is called. Inside this function, we accept the incoming websocket connection and enter into a `while` loop to continuously listen for messages from the client. When a message is received, we send a response back to the client with a prefix "You wrote: " followed by the received data.

## Running the FastAPI WebSocket Server

Now that we have set up our FastAPI websocket server, we can start it by running the following command in your terminal:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:8000`. If you navigate to `http://localhost:8000/ws` in your web browser, you will see a message indicating that a websocket connection has been established.

To test the websocket communication, open your browser's developer console and enter the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws');

socket.onopen = function(event) {
    console.log('Websocket connection established');
    socket.send('Hello, server!');
};

socket.onmessage = function(event) {
    console.log('Message from server:', event.data);
};

socket.onclose = function(event) {
    console.log('Websocket connection closed');
};
```

When you run the above code, you will see the message "Websocket connection established" in the console. The client will send a message "Hello, server!" to the server, which will respond with "You wrote: Hello, server!".

## Conclusion

FastAPI's websocket support allows us to build real-time communication capabilities into our applications easily. In this blog post, we covered the basics of setting up a websocket server using FastAPI and tested it with a simple client. You can now utilize the power of websockets in your FastAPI applications to deliver real-time updates and build interactive features.
