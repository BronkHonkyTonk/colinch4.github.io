Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful technique used in various fields, including finance, physics, and computer science. It involves using random numbers to simulate and solve complex problems. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform a Monte Carlo simulation using the `mpmath` library in Python.

## What is mpmath?

`mpmath` is a Python library that provides arbitrary precision arithmetic and extensive mathematical functions. It is an ideal tool for performing calculations with high precision requirements, such as Monte Carlo simulations.

## Installing mpmath

You can install `mpmath` using `pip` by running the following command:

```python
pip install mpmath
```

## Performing a simple Monte Carlo simulation

Let's start by performing a simple Monte Carlo simulation using `mpmath`. In this example, we will estimate the value of π (pi) by randomly generating points inside a unit square.

```python
import mpmath
import random

def estimate_pi(num_points):
    mpmath.mp.dps = 50  # Set the precision to 50 decimal places
    count = 0

    for _ in range(num_points):
        x = random.uniform(0, 1)
        y = random.uniform(0, 1)

        if x**2 + y**2 <= 1:
            count += 1

    pi_estimate = (4 * count) / num_points
    return pi_estimate

result = estimate_pi(1000000)
print("Estimated value of π:", result)
```

Here, we define the `estimate_pi` function that takes the number of points as input. We set the precision of `mpmath` to 50 decimal places and use a `for` loop to generate random points. If a point falls inside the unit circle (x^2 + y^2 <= 1), we increment the count. Finally, we calculate the estimated value of π based on the count of points inside the unit circle.

## Conclusion

`mpmath` is a valuable library for performing Monte Carlo simulations with high precision requirements. We have explored a simple example of estimating π using the library. Feel free to experiment with different Monte Carlo simulations to solve various complex problems.
