FastAPI is a powerful and efficient Python framework for building APIs. It allows us to handle simple as well as complex tasks easily. One such feature of FastAPI is the ability to run **background tasks** alongside HTTP requests. In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage this feature and execute background tasks in FastAPI.

## Background Tasks in FastAPI

FastAPI provides a straightforward way to run background tasks using the `BackgroundTasks` class. 

To define a background task, we need to create an asynchronous function and use the `BackgroundTasks` instance to enqueue it. Here's an example:

```python
from fastapi import BackgroundTasks, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

def my_background_task():
    # Do some background processing here
    print("Executing background task")

@app.post("/task")
async def create_task(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    background_tasks.add_task(my_background_task)
    return {"message": "Task has been queued"}
```

In the example above, we define a background task function `my_background_task()` which will be executed asynchronously. Inside this function, you can perform any computationally expensive or time-consuming operation. 

In the `/task` route, we inject the `BackgroundTasks` instance as a parameter. We then use the `add_task()` method to enqueue our background task function. 

The background task will be executed after the corresponding HTTP response has been returned to the client, ensuring minimal impact on the API's response time.

## Running Multiple Background Tasks

FastAPI allows us to execute multiple background tasks at once. We simply need to add multiple tasks using the `add_task()` method.

Here's an example of queuing multiple background tasks:

```python
@app.post("/multi-task")
async def create_multiple_tasks(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    background_tasks.add_task(my_background_task)
    background_tasks.add_task(another_background_task)
    return {"message": "Multiple tasks have been queued"}
```

In the example above, we simply add more calls to the `add_task()` method to enqueue additional background tasks.

## Conclusion

FastAPI's background tasks feature provides a convenient way to perform long-running or computationally expensive operations without blocking the API's response. By leveraging this feature, we can build highly performant and efficient APIs with ease.

In this blog post, we explored how to use background tasks in FastAPI and saw examples of queuing single and multiple tasks. The ability to run background tasks opens up a wide range of possibilities for handling asynchronous execution in our web applications.

If you haven't tried FastAPI yet, I highly recommend giving it a shot and experiencing the power and simplicity it offers.

Happy coding!
