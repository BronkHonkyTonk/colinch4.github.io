In Python, logging is a crucial aspect of any application. It helps developers to effectively debug and monitor the program's behavior. One way to add logging to our Python code is by using **functools decorators**. Decorators allow us to modify the behavior of a function or class without changing its source code. In this blog post, we will explore how to use functools decorators to add logging in Python.

## Logging Basics

Before diving into functools decorators, let's quickly go over the basics of logging in Python. The `logging` module provides a powerful and flexible way of logging messages from our program. It allows us to configure various settings, such as log levels, output format, and log file.

To start logging in our Python program, we need to import the `logging` module and configure the logging settings. Here's a simple example:

```python
import logging

# Configure logging settings
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,
                    format='%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s')
```

In this example, we configure the logging level to `INFO`, which means that all log messages with a severity level of `INFO` or higher will be logged. We also define the log message format using the `format` parameter.

To log messages, we can use the `logging` module's various logging functions, such as `logging.debug()`, `logging.info()`, `logging.warning()`, etc. Each function corresponds to a specific severity level.

## Using Functools Decorators for Logging

Functools decorators provide an elegant way to add logging to our functions or methods. A decorator is a function that takes another function as input and returns a modified version of the input function. Here's an example of a simple logging decorator using functools:

```python
import functools
import logging

# Configure logging settings
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,
                    format='%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s')

def log_function_calls(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        logging.info(f"Calling function: {func.__name__}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        logging.info(f"Function {func.__name__} called successfully")
        return result
    return wrapper
```

In this example, we define a decorator `log_function_calls` that logs the function name before and after calling it. The `functools.wraps` decorator is used to preserve the original function's name and documentation.

To apply this decorator to a function, we simply prepend the function with the `@` symbol followed by the decorator name:

```python
@log_function_calls
def my_function():
    # Function implementation
    pass
```

Now, every time `my_function` is called, it will automatically log the function name before and after execution.

## Conclusion

Functools decorators provide a clean and reusable way to add logging to our Python code. By leveraging decorators, we can easily enhance our functions or methods with logging capabilities, without cluttering the code with repetitive logging statements.

In this blog post, we explored the basics of logging in Python and learned how to use functools decorators for adding logging. This is just one of the many use cases of decorators in Python, and they can be applied in various scenarios to enhance the functionality of our code.

So the next time you find yourself in need of adding logging to your Python program, remember to consider using functools decorators!
