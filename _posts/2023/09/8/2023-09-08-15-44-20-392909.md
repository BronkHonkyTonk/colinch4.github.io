In Python, the `pathlib` module provides an object-oriented approach to handle file system paths. It offers a clearer and more concise way to interact with files and directories compared to the traditional `os.path` module.

However, one of the most powerful aspects of `pathlib` is its ability to be extended and customized according to your specific needs. In this blog post, we will explore how you can extend `pathlib` and define your own custom methods.

## Extending pathlib

You can extend `pathlib` by creating a subclass of `Path` and adding your own methods and properties. Let's say we want to create a custom path object that has a method to count the number of files in a directory. Here's an example:

```python
import pathlib

class CustomPath(pathlib.Path):
    def count_files(self):
        count = 0
        for file in self.iterdir():
            if file.is_file():
                count += 1

        return count

# Usage:
dir_path = CustomPath('/path/to/directory')
file_count = dir_path.count_files()
print(f"Number of files in directory: {file_count}")
```

In the above code, we create a subclass `CustomPath` that inherits from `pathlib.Path`. We then define a `count_files` method that iterates over the files in the directory and increments the count for each file. Finally, we create an instance of `CustomPath` and call the `count_files` method to get the file count.

## Usage of CustomPath

Now, let's explore some of the use-cases where extending `pathlib` can be beneficial.

### Custom Path Validation

You can define custom validation methods to ensure that a path meets certain criteria. For example, let's create a method `is_media_file` that checks if a file has a valid media file extension:

```python
import pathlib

class CustomPath(pathlib.Path):
    def is_media_file(self):
        valid_extensions = ['.mp3', '.mp4', '.avi', '.mkv']
        return self.suffix.lower() in valid_extensions

# Usage:
file_path = CustomPath('/path/to/file.mp3')
is_media = file_path.is_media_file()
print(f"Is media file: {is_media}")
```

### Custom Path Manipulation

You can define custom methods to manipulate paths in a specific way. For example, let's create a method `add_suffix` that adds a suffix to the file name:

```python
import pathlib

class CustomPath(pathlib.Path):
    def add_suffix(self, suffix):
        new_name = f"{self.stem}_{suffix}{self.suffix}"
        return self.with_name(new_name)

# Usage:
file_path = CustomPath('/path/to/file.txt')
new_path = file_path.add_suffix('backup')
print(f"New path: {new_path}")
```

## Conclusion

`pathlib` is a powerful module in Python for handling file system paths. By extending and customizing it, you can create your own methods and properties to fit your specific needs. This allows for greater flexibility and simplicity when working with file paths.
