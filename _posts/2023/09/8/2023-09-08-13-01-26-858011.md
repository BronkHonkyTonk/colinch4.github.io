The *mpmath* library is a powerful mathematical tool in Python that allows high-precision numerical computations. In this blog post, we will explore how mpmath can be used to verify Fermat's Last Theorem.

## What is Fermat's Last Theorem?

Fermat's Last Theorem states that no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer value of n greater than 2. This theorem, proposed by Pierre de Fermat in 1637, remained unproven for over 350 years until it was finally solved by Andrew Wiles in 1994 using complex mathematical techniques.

## Using mpmath to Verify Fermat's Last Theorem

mpmath provides a high-level interface for mathematical computations with arbitrary precision. We can use this library to evaluate the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for different values of a, b, c, and n to verify Fermat's Last Theorem.

Here's an example of how to use mpmath to verify the equation for a specific case:

```python
import mpmath

def verify_fermat_theorem(a, b, c, n):
    lhs = mpmath.power(a, n) + mpmath.power(b, n)
    rhs = mpmath.power(c, n)
    return mpmath.almosteq(lhs, rhs)

a = 3
b = 4
c = 5
n = 2

result = verify_fermat_theorem(a, b, c, n)
print(f"The equation is {result}")
```

In this code, we define a function `verify_fermat_theorem` that takes the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n` as input. It calculates the left-hand side (lhs) and the right-hand side (rhs) of the equation using the `mpmath` library. We then use the `mpmath.almosteq()` function to check if the two sides are approximately equal.

In the example, we test the equation for a=3, b=4, c=5, and n=2. The output will be `The equation is True` since 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 (9 + 16 = 25).

## Conclusion

mpmath is a powerful library that can be used to perform high-precision mathematical computations in Python. In this blog post, we demonstrated how to use mpmath to verify Fermat's Last Theorem by evaluating the equation a^n + b^n = c^n. While this example is for a specific case, you can extend it to test other values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n` as well.

Remember that Fermat's Last Theorem has been proven to hold for all values of `n` greater than 2, but mpmath can be a useful tool to explore and experiment with mathematical equations and verify their properties.
