Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool used for pattern matching and manipulating strings in programming languages like Python. Python's `re` module provides a wide range of functions to work with regex. One such function is `re.purge()`, which allows you to remove all the compiled regex patterns from the module's internal cache.

### Syntax

Here's the syntax for `re.purge()`:

```python
re.purge()
```

### Purpose

The purpose of `re.purge()` is to remove all the compiled regex patterns that have been cached by the `re` module. The internal cache is used to store compiled regex patterns for efficiency, so that they do not have to be recompiled every time they are used. However, in certain cases, you may want to clear the cache and remove all the patterns. This can be useful if you want to free up memory or if you want to ensure that the module is not using any outdated patterns.

### Example

Let's see an example of how to use `re.purge()`:

```python
import re

# Compile some regex patterns
pattern1 = re.compile(r'\d+')
pattern2 = re.compile(r'[a-z]+')

# Match patterns
result1 = pattern1.findall('1234')
result2 = pattern2.findall('abcde')

# Remove all the compiled patterns from cache
re.purge()

# Try to match again
result3 = pattern1.findall('1234')  # This will raise an error
result4 = pattern2.findall('abcde')  # This will raise an error
```

In the above example, we first compile two regex patterns using the `re.compile()` function. We then use these patterns to match strings. Afterward, we call `re.purge()` to remove all cached patterns. Finally, when we try to use the patterns again, an error will be raised because the patterns no longer exist in the cache.

### Conclusion

The `re.purge()` function is a handy tool in Python's `re` module for removing all the compiled regex patterns from the cache. It can be used when you want to clear the cache to free up memory or ensure that outdated patterns are not used.
