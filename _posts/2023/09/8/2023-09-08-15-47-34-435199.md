## Introduction

In Python, the `functools` module provides a set of higher-order functions that can be used to manipulate or extend the behavior of other functions. On the other hand, the Builder pattern is a design pattern that helps in constructing complex objects step by step. In this blog post, we will explore how `functools` and the Builder pattern can be used together to create robust and flexible code in Python.

## functools Module

The `functools` module in Python provides several useful functions for functional programming. Here are a few key functions:

1. `partial`: This function allows us to fix a few arguments of a function and generate a new function with the remaining arguments.
2. `wraps`: This function is used as a decorator to make a new function or a class method more like the original function, including its name, docstring, and attributes.
3. `partialmethod`: This function is similar to `partial`, but can be used to create a partial function that is bound to a class method.

Using these functions from the `functools` module, we can modify or enhance the behavior of functions in a flexible and modular way.

## Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that allows the creation of complex objects by separating the construction process from their representation. This pattern is useful when the object creation involves multiple steps and configurations.

The main components of the Builder pattern are:

1. Builder: An abstract interface that specifies the operations for creating different parts of the object.
2. Concrete Builder: The implementation of the Builder interface that provides different methods for constructing the object.
3. Director: Controls the construction process using the Builder.
4. Product: The final object that is constructed by the Builder.

By using the Builder pattern, you can create objects step by step, customize their construction process, and ensure that the final object is consistent and well-constructed.

## Combining functools and the Builder Pattern

Now, let's see an example of how `functools` and the Builder pattern can be combined to create a flexible and efficient code structure. Suppose we want to build a complex object, such as an Email message, with various configurations and options.

We can start by defining a Builder class that handles the construction process:

```python
class EmailBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.email = Email()

    def set_subject(self, subject):
        self.email.subject = subject
        return self

    def set_body(self, body):
        self.email.body = body
        return self

    def set_sender(self, sender):
        self.email.sender = sender
        return self

    def set_recipient(self, recipient):
        self.email.recipient = recipient
        return self

    def build(self):
        return self.email
```

Next, we can use the `functools` module to enhance the Builder class by using function composition. For example, we can use `partialmethod` to create partial builder methods that are specialized for specific configurations:

```python
from functools import partialmethod

class EmailBuilder:
    # ... existing methods ...

    set_subject_default = partialmethod(set_subject, "Default Subject")
    set_body_default = partialmethod(set_body, "Default Body")

    def set_priority(self, priority):
        self.email.priority = priority
        return self
```

In the above code, `set_subject_default` and `set_body_default` are partial methods that fix the default values for the subject and body of the email. We can use these methods directly, or we can still use the original methods and provide custom values.

Finally, we can create a Director class that controls the construction process, making use of the enhanced Builder class:

```python
class EmailDirector:
    def __init__(self, builder):
        self.builder = builder

    def construct_email(self):
        email = self.builder.set_subject_default() \
            .set_body_default() \
            .set_sender("example@example.com") \
            .set_recipient("recipient@example.com") \
            .set_priority("High") \
            .build()
        return email
```

In the above code, the Director class uses the Builder to construct the email, providing default values for some attributes and custom values for others.

## Conclusion

By combining `functools` and the Builder pattern in Python, we can create code that is modular, flexible, and maintainable. The `functools` module provides powerful tools for function manipulation, while the Builder pattern allows for the creation of complex objects in a step-by-step manner. Using these techniques together can result in elegant code with a clear separation of concerns.
