Airflow is an open-source platform used for orchestrating complex workflows and data pipelines. Logging is an essential aspect of any application, including Airflow, as it helps in debugging, monitoring, and tracing application activities. In this blog post, we will explore how to configure logging in Airflow using Python.

## Setting up Logging in Airflow

Step 1: Import the required modules
```python
import logging
import airflow.utils.log.logging_mixin
```

Step 2: Define the logging configuration
```python
LOG_FORMAT = '%(asctime)s %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=LOG_FORMAT)
```

Above, we define the format of the log messages using the `LOG_FORMAT` variable. You can customize this format according to your preference. The `basicConfig` method from the `logging` module sets the root logger's configuration.

Step 3: Configure logging for Airflow

Airflow uses its own loggers to log various events, such as task execution, task failures, and system events. To configure logging for Airflow, we need to update the `airflow.cfg` file.

```python
[logging]
logging_level = INFO
log_filename = /path/to/airflow/logs/airflow.log
```

You can find the `airflow.cfg` file in the Airflow installation directory or in the `AIRFLOW_HOME` directory if you have initialized it. Update the `logging_level` and `log_filename` properties as per your requirements.

Step 4: Use the logger in your code

Now that logging is configured, you can use it in your code to log messages of different levels like `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARNING`, etc.

```python
# Log an info message
logging.info("This is an information message")

# Log a warning message
logging.warning("This is a warning message")
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to configure logging in Airflow using Python. By setting up logging, you can easily monitor your Airflow workflows and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. Remember to customize the logging configuration according to your application requirements.

Logging plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of any application, and Airflow is no exception. It enables you to track and analyze the execution of tasks within your workflows, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

I hope this article helps you in understanding the process of logging in Airflow and encourages you to implement logging practices in your workflows.
