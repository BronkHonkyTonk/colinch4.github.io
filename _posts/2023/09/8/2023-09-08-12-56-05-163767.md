Sympy is a powerful symbolic mathematics library for Python that allows solving various mathematical problems, including numerical solutions. One of the functions provided by sympy for numerical solving is `nsolve`. In this blog post, we will explore how to use `nsolve` to find numerical solutions to equations in Python.

## Installing Sympy

Before we begin, make sure you have sympy installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:

```
pip install sympy
```

## Using `nsolve` to Find Numerical Solutions

`nsolve` is a function in sympy that can be used to find numerical solutions to a given equation. It uses numerical methods such as Newton's method or the secant method to find the solution.

To use `nsolve`, you need to define your equation and provide an initial guess for the solution. The function will then iterate using the chosen numerical method until it finds a satisfactory solution.

Let's look at an example to understand how to use `nsolve`.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, nsolve

# Define the symbol
x = symbols('x')

# Define the equation
equation = Eq(x**2 - 2, 0)

# Find the numerical solution
solution = nsolve(equation, 1)

# Print the solution
print(f"Numerical solution: {solution}")
```

In the example code above, we are solving the equation x^2 - 2 = 0 using `nsolve`. We define the symbol `x` using `symbols` and create the equation using `Eq`. Then, we use `nsolve` with the equation and an initial guess of 1 to find the numerical solution. Finally, we print the solution.

## Adjusting the Tolerance and Iteration Limit

By default, `nsolve` uses a tolerance of 1e-10 and a maximum of 50 iterations. However, you can adjust these parameters according to your needs. The tolerance determines how close the solution needs to be to zero, and the iteration limit determines how many iterations `nsolve` will perform before stopping.

To adjust the tolerance and iteration limit, pass them as arguments to `nsolve`:

```python
solution = nsolve(equation, 1, tol=1e-6, maxiter=100)
```

In the example above, we set the tolerance to 1e-6 and the maximum iteration limit to 100.

## Conclusion

Sympy's `nsolve` function provides a convenient way to find numerical solutions to equations in Python. By using this function, you can easily solve complex equations without resorting to manual calculations.
