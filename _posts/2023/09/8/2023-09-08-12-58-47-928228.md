In scientific computing, precision and accuracy are crucial. The `mpmath` library in Python provides a way to work with arbitrary-precision floating-point numbers. It allows us to specify the precision of our calculations and control the format and output of the computed results.

In this blog post, we will explore how to format and configure the output of floats in `mpmath`.

## Setting the Precision

Before we dive into formatting and output options, let's briefly discuss how to set the precision for `mpmath` computations.

```python
import mpmath

mp.dps = 25  # set precision to 25 decimal places
```

In the above code, `mp.dps` stands for "decimal places" and determines the precision of the computations. You can adjust the value as per your requirements.

## Formatting Floats

In `mpmath`, we have control over how the computed results are formatted. We can specify the format using the `mp.pretty` context. Let's look at some formatting options:

### Scientific Notation

```python
from mpmath import mp

with mp.pretty():
    mp.pretty = True  # Enable scientific notation
    x = mp.mpf('12345678901234567890')
    print(x)  # Prints 1.2345678901234567890e+19
```

By setting `pretty` to `True`, the float will be displayed in scientific notation. This can be useful when dealing with very large or very small numbers.

### Fixed Point Notation

```python
from mpmath import mp

with mp.pretty():
    mp.pretty = False  # Disable scientific notation
    x = mp.mpf('1.2345678901234567890')
    print(x)  # Prints 1.2345678901234567890
```

By setting `pretty` to `False`, the float will be displayed in fixed-point notation. This is often more visually appealing for general-purpose computations.

## Rounding

Sometimes, we may want to round the computed results to a specific number of decimal places.

```python
from mpmath import mp

with mp.pretty():
    mp.dps = 10
    x = mp.pi
    print(x)  # Prints 3.1415926536
```

By adjusting the `mp.dps` variable, we can round the computed result to the desired number of decimal places.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to format and configure the output of floats in `mpmath`. We learned how to set the precision, use scientific and fixed-point notation, and round the computed results.

By having control over the formatting and output, we can ensure the accuracy and presentability of our scientific computations.

The `mpmath` library provides many more advanced options and functionalities for working with arbitrary-precision floating-point numbers. I encourage you to explore the official documentation for more information.
