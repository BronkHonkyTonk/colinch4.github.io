FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and provides high performance thanks to asynchronous programming using `async` and `await` keywords.

### What is `async`/`await`?

`async` and `await` are keywords introduced in Python 3.5 that allow for writing asynchronous code. Asynchronous programming allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, improving overall performance and responsiveness of your application.

`async` is used to define a coroutine, which is a function that can be paused and resumed at a later time. It indicates that the function will contain `await` expressions and will be executed asynchronously.

`await` is used to pause the execution of a coroutine until a certain condition is met. It can only be used inside an `async` function and allows other tasks to be performed while waiting for the awaited condition to complete.

### Async Functions in FastAPI

FastAPI leverages the power of `async`/`await` to create highly scalable and efficient APIs. You can use `async` functions as route handlers in FastAPI to perform asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from a database or calling external APIs.

Let's take a look at an example where we fetch data from a database asynchronously using `async`/`await`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from databases import Database

app = FastAPI()

async def fetch_data_from_db():
    database = Database(...)
    await database.connect()
    query = "SELECT * FROM users"
    result = await database.fetch_all(query)
    await database.disconnect()
    return result

@app.get("/users")
async def get_users():
    users = await fetch_data_from_db()
    return users
```

In the example above, the `get_users` route handler is defined as an `async` function. It calls the `fetch_data_from_db` function, which is also asynchronous. Inside the `fetch_data_from_db` function, we perform the database operations asynchronously using `await`, allowing other tasks to be executed while waiting for the database operations to complete.

### Benefits of Using async/await in FastAPI

- **Scalability**: Using `async`/`await` allows your FastAPI application to handle a larger number of concurrent requests without blocking the execution of other tasks.
- **Improved Performance**: Asynchronous code allows your application to take advantage of the underlying event loop, resulting in faster response times and improved efficiency.
- **Simplified Code**: Asynchronous code using `async`/`await` is often more readable and easier to manage compared to traditional synchronous code with callbacks or threads.

### Conclusion

FastAPI is a powerful web framework for building APIs with Python, and it leverages `async`/`await` to enable high-performance, scalable, and efficient applications. By using `async` functions as route handlers, you can easily perform asynchronous operations without blocking the execution of your application.

If you're looking to build fast and scalable APIs, give FastAPI and `async`/`await` a try in your Python projects.
