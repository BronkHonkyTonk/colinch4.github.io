Python's built-in `collections` module provides three useful classes: `UserDict`, `UserList`, and `UserString`. These classes are subclasses of the respective built-in classes `dict`, `list`, and `str`, with additional functionalities.

## UserDict

`UserDict` is a handy class that allows you to create your own dictionary-like objects. It inherits from the `dict` class and provides a more convenient way to define dictionary behaviors.

Here's an example of how to use `UserDict` to create a custom dictionary class:

```python
from collections import UserDict

class MyDictionary(UserDict):
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        super().__setitem__(key, value * 2)
```

In this example, we've created a `MyDictionary` class that doubles the value set for each key. Now, when we use an instance of `MyDictionary`, the values will be automatically doubled:

```python
my_dict = MyDictionary()
my_dict['apple'] = 5
my_dict['orange'] = 10

print(my_dict)  # Output: {'apple': 10, 'orange': 20}
```

## UserList

`UserList` is a subclass of `list` that allows you to create your own list-like objects. It provides additional methods and behaviors, making it convenient to work with custom lists.

Here's an example of how to use `UserList` to create a custom list class:

```python
from collections import UserList

class MyList(UserList):
    def remove_duplicates(self):
        self.data = list(set(self.data))
```

In this example, we've created a `MyList` class that removes duplicate elements from the list. The `remove_duplicates` method removes duplicates using the `set` function.

Now, let's see how we can use `MyList` and call the `remove_duplicates` method:

```python
my_list = MyList([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5])
my_list.remove_duplicates()

print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## UserString

`UserString` is a subclass of `str` that allows you to create your own string-like objects. It provides additional methods and behaviors for custom string manipulation.

Here's an example of how to use `UserString` to create a custom string class:

```python
from collections import UserString

class MyString(UserString):
    def reverse(self):
        return self.data[::-1]
```

In this example, we've created a `MyString` class that implements a `reverse` method to reverse the string. The `[::-1]` slicing syntax is used to reverse the string.

Now, let's see how we can use `MyString` and call the `reverse` method:

```python
my_string = MyString("Hello World")
reversed_string = my_string.reverse()

print(reversed_string)  # Output: "dlroW olleH"
```

In conclusion, the `collections` module in Python provides the `UserDict`, `UserList`, and `UserString` classes which can be used to create custom dictionary, list, and string objects respectively. They offer additional functionalities and can be extended to suit specific requirements.
