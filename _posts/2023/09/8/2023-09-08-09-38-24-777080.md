FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use, fast to develop with, and highly efficient.

When building APIs with FastAPI, it is essential to ensure proper monitoring and logging of the API endpoints. Monitoring allows you to collect and analyze data about your API's performance, while logging helps you track errors and exceptions for debugging purposes.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement monitoring and logging in a FastAPI application.

## Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. It allows you to collect metrics from your APIs and store them for analysis and visualization. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is a popular open-source analytics and monitoring platform that provides a rich set of visualizations for Prometheus data.

To monitor FastAPI using Prometheus and Grafana, follow these steps:

1. Install Prometheus and Grafana using their respective documentation.
2. Import the necessary libraries in your FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator import Instrumentator
```

3. Initialize the FastAPI application and add the Instrumentator middleware:

```python
app = FastAPI()

Instrumentator().instrument(app).expose(app)
```

4. Start your FastAPI application and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/metrics` to see the Prometheus metrics endpoint.

5. Configure Grafana to visualize the metrics from Prometheus.

Now you can monitor your FastAPI application's performance using Prometheus and Grafana.

## Logging with Python logging module

The logging module in Python is a powerful tool for capturing and storing application logs. It provides different log levels, handlers, and formatters to configure log output as desired.

To enable logging in a FastAPI application, follow these steps:

1. Import the logging module in your FastAPI application:

```python
import logging
```

2. Set up the logging configuration at the beginning of your application:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

3. Use the logger to log messages throughout your application:

```python
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("API request received")
```

4. Configure the desired log handlers and formatters for your application.

By default, the logs will be displayed in the console. You can configure additional handlers to log to files, databases, or external services.

## Conclusion

Implementing monitoring and logging in a FastAPI application is crucial for understanding and improving its performance. With Prometheus and Grafana, you can collect and analyze metrics, while the logging module allows you to capture and store logs for debugging purposes.

By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can effectively monitor and log your FastAPI API with ease.
