Regular expressions are a powerful tool used for pattern matching and text manipulation. The standard regex syntax provides a wide range of capabilities, but sometimes you may need more advanced features. In such cases, Python offers an extended regular expression syntax that expands upon the basic syntax.

## Lookahead and Lookbehind Assertions

Lookahead and lookbehind assertions are non-capturing groups that allow you to match patterns based on what comes before or after a specific position without actually including those characters in the result.

- Lookahead assertion syntax: `(?=pattern)` and `(?!pattern)`
- Lookbehind assertion syntax: `(?<=pattern)` and `(?<!pattern)`

Example:
```python
import re

text = "Hello World"

# Lookahead assertion: matches "Hello" only if it is followed by " World"
matches = re.findall(r"Hello(?= World)", text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['Hello']

# Lookbehind assertion: matches "World" only if it is preceded by "Hello "
matches = re.findall(r"(?<=Hello )World", text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['World']
```

## Named Capture Groups

Capture groups allow you to extract specific parts of a matched pattern. With named capture groups, you can assign a name to a group making it easier to reference in your code.

Named capture group syntax: `(?P<name>pattern)`

Example:
```python
import re

text = "My name is John"

# Matches "My name is {name}"
pattern = r"My name is (?P<name>\w+)"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
print(match.group('name'))  # Output: 'John'
```

## Inline Flags

Inline flags allow you to modify the behavior of regular expressions within a specific part of the pattern. They are useful when you want to enable or disable flags for a particular section.

Inline flag syntax: `(?aiLmsux)`

Example:
```python
import re

text = "Hello World\nThis is a Test"

# Matches "HELLO" followed by "is a test"
pattern = r"(?i)hello(?-i).*test"
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['Hello World\nThis is a Test']
```

## Conclusion

The extended regular expression syntax in Python provides additional flexibility and power when working with complex pattern matching tasks. By utilizing lookahead/lookbehind assertions, named capture groups, and inline flags, you can handle more advanced text manipulation scenarios. Experiment with these features to enhance your regex skills and make your code more efficient.
