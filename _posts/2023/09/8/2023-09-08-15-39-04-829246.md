In Python, the `functools` module provides various tools for working with functions. One of the powerful features of `functools` is the ability to create function callback chains. This allows you to apply multiple functions to an input value sequentially, with each function taking the output of the previous one as its input.

In this blog post, we will explore how to create callback chains using the `functools` module in Python.

## Getting Started

To use the `functools` module, we need to import it:

```python
import functools
```

## Creating a Simple Callback Chain

Let's start by creating a simple callback chain. Suppose we have three functions: `add_two`, `multiply_by_three`, and `subtract_five`. We want to apply these functions in the given order to a single input value.

First, let's define the functions:

```python
def add_two(x):
    return x + 2

def multiply_by_three(x):
    return x * 3

def subtract_five(x):
    return x - 5
```

Now, we can create a callback chain using `partial` from the `functools` module:

```python
callback_chain = functools.partial(subtract_five, **{'callback': multiply_by_three})  # Step 1: Subtract 5 and pass result to multiply_by_three
callback_chain = functools.partial(multiply_by_three, **{'callback': add_two})  # Step 2: Multiply by 3 and pass result to add_two
```

Notice how each function is passed as a callback to the previous function using the `callback` argument.

## Applying the Callback Chain

To apply the callback chain to a specific input value, we need to call the last function in the chain. In our example, the last function is `callback_chain`. Let's apply the callback chain to the number 10:

```python
result = callback_chain(10)
print(result)
```

The output will be:

```
37
```

Explanation: The input value of 10 goes through each function in the chain:

1. `subtract_five(10)` returns 5.
2. `multiply_by_three(5)` returns 15.
3. `add_two(15)` returns 17.

## Conclusion

Using the `functools` module in Python, we can easily create callback chains to apply multiple functions to an input value. This allows for flexible and reusable code, as different functions can be combined in various callback chains.

In this blog post, we explored the basic concept of creating callback chains using `functools.partial`. You can extend this concept to include more complex functions and even pass additional arguments to the functions in the chain.

Remember to experiment and explore the powerful capabilities of `functools` to create your own callback chains and optimize your code.
