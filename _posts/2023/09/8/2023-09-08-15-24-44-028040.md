**`functools`** is a powerful module in Python's standard library that provides various higher-order functions and function decorators. One particularly useful feature of `functools` is the ability to chain functions together using the `functools.reduce()` function.

## Using `functools.reduce()` to chain functions

The `functools.reduce()` function is used to apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value.

Let's consider an example where we have a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and we want to chain multiple functions together to perform a series of operations on each element of the list.

```python
import functools

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Example functions
def double(x):
    return x * 2

def add_five(x):
    return x + 5

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Chain functions using functools.reduce()
result = functools.reduce(lambda x, f: f(x), [double, add_five, square], numbers)

print(result)  # Output: 196
```

In the above example, `double`, `add_five`, and `square` are functions that we want to apply to each number in the `numbers` list. We use `functools.reduce()` to apply these functions in the given order to each element of the list.

The `lambda x, f: f(x)` expression is used as the combining function in `reduce()`. It takes a value `x` (the intermediate result) and a function `f`, and applies the function `f` to `x`.

The output of the above code will be `196` because we chained the functions `double`, `add_five`, and `square` together and applied them to each element of the `numbers` list sequentially.

## Conclusion

Using `functools.reduce()` to chain functions together can be a powerful tool when performing a series of operations on an iterable. It allows for concise and elegant code by eliminating the need for nested function calls or intermediate variables.

By leveraging the capabilities of `functools` module in Python, you can enhance the readability and maintainability of your code while achieving the desired functionality.
