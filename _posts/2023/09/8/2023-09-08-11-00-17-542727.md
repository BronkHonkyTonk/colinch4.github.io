**FIPS 140-2** is a U.S. government computer security standard used to approve cryptographic modules. It defines the requirements for the design, implementation, and testing of cryptographic modules. If you are working with sensitive data or need to comply with security regulations, it is essential to ensure that your cryptographic module is FIPS 140-2 compliant.

**PyCrypto** is a popular library for encryption and cryptographic functions in Python. However, it is important to note that the default build of PyCrypto is not FIPS 140-2 compliant. To use a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module in Python, you can leverage **PyCryptodome**.

PyCryptodome is a drop-in replacement for PyCrypto and provides a FIPS-compliant implementation called `Crypto.Cipher`. To use the FIPS-compliant module, follow these steps:

1. Install PyCryptodome using pip:

    ```python
    pip install pycryptodome
    ```

2. Import the FIPS-compliant `Crypto.Cipher` module:

    ```python
    from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES, DES, DES3
    ```

3. The FIPS-compliant mode of operations include AES, DES, and TripleDES. You can now use these cryptographic algorithms as follows:

    - AES example:

        ```python
        key = b'your_AES_key'
        cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)
        
        data = b'sensitive_data'
        encrypted_data = cipher.encrypt(data)
        decrypted_data = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data)
        
        print(decrypted_data.decode())
        ```
        
    - DES example:
    
        ```python
        key = b'your_DES_key'
        cipher = DES.new(key, DES.MODE_ECB)
        
        data = b'sensitive_data'
        encrypted_data = cipher.encrypt(data)
        decrypted_data = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data)
        
        print(decrypted_data.decode())
        ```
        
    - TripleDES example:
    
        ```python
        key = b'your_3DES_key'
        cipher = DES3.new(key, DES3.MODE_ECB)
        
        data = b'sensitive_data'
        encrypted_data = cipher.encrypt(data)
        decrypted_data = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data)
        
        print(decrypted_data.decode())
        ```

By using PyCryptodome and its FIPS-compliant `Crypto.Cipher` module, you can ensure that your cryptographic operations in Python meet the FIPS 140-2 standard. Remember to properly handle and store your encryption keys based on your security requirements to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data.
