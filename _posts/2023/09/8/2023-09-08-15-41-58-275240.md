The `pathlib` module in Python provides a convenient way to work with file system paths. It includes two classes, `PureWindowsPath` and `PurePosixPath`, which offer platform-specific path manipulation.

### `PureWindowsPath`
The `PureWindowsPath` class is used when working with Windows file paths. It provides methods and attributes specific to Windows-based systems, such as drive letters and backslashes for path separation.

Here's an example of how to use `PureWindowsPath`:

```python
from pathlib import PureWindowsPath

# Create a PureWindowsPath object
windows_path = PureWindowsPath('C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\file.txt')

# Print the individual components of the path
print(f"Drive: {windows_path.drive}")
print(f"Directory: {windows_path.parent}")
print(f"Filename: {windows_path.name}")

# Join additional path components
new_path = windows_path.parent / 'new_directory' / windows_path.name
print(f"New Path: {new_path}")
```

In the above code snippet, we first create a `PureWindowsPath` object by passing a Windows file path as a string. We then access the various components of the path using attributes like `drive`, `parent`, and `name`.

We can also join additional path components by using the `/` operator.

### `PurePosixPath`
The `PurePosixPath` class, on the other hand, is used for working with POSIX-style file paths, typically found on Unix-based systems. It uses forward slashes as the path separator and does not include Windows-specific attributes like drive letters.

Here's an example of using `PurePosixPath`:

```python
from pathlib import PurePosixPath

# Create a PurePosixPath object
posix_path = PurePosixPath('/home/username/documents/file.txt')

# Print the individual components of the path
print(f"Root: {posix_path.root}")
print(f"Directory: {posix_path.parent}")
print(f"Filename: {posix_path.name}")

# Join additional path components
new_path = posix_path.parent / 'new_directory' / posix_path.name
print(f"New Path: {new_path}")
```
In the above code, we create a `PurePosixPath` object by passing a POSIX-style path as a string. We then access the different parts of the path using attributes like `root`, `parent`, and `name`. Additional path components can also be joined using the `/` operator.

By using the appropriate class depending on the platform, `PureWindowsPath` or `PurePosixPath`, you can write portable code that handles file paths correctly for the given operating system.
