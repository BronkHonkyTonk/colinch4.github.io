Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means that functions can work with different kinds of arguments. However, there may be situations where you want to define different behaviors for a function based on the type of arguments it receives. This is where functools 동적 함수 디스패치 (dynamic function dispatch) comes into play.

## What is 동적 함수 디스패치?

Dynamic function dispatch, also known as multiple dispatch or multimethods, is a programming pattern that allows a function to have multiple implementations, each corresponding to a specific combination of argument types. This pattern comes in handy when you want to perform different actions based on the type of arguments passed to a function.

## Using functools.singledispatch

Python's `functools` module provides a decorator called `singledispatch`, which allows you to implement 동적 함수 디스패치. Here's how you can use it:

```python
from functools import singledispatch

@singledispatch
def process_data(data):
    raise NotImplementedError("Unsupported data type")

@process_data.register
def process_int(data: int):
    print(f"Processing integer: {data}")

@process_data.register
def process_str(data: str):
    print(f"Processing string: {data}")

@process_data.register
def process_list(data: list):
    print(f"Processing list: {data}")
```

In the code above, we define a function `process_data(data)` and decorate it with `@singledispatch`. This decorator ensures that different implementations of the function can be registered based on the type of the argument.

We then define three different implementations of `process_data` using the `@process_data.register` decorator and specify the corresponding argument types.

Now, let's test our `process_data` function:

```python
process_data(10)  # Processing integer: 10
process_data("Hello")  # Processing string: Hello
process_data([1, 2, 3])  # Processing list: [1, 2, 3]
```

As you can see, the `process_data` function dispatches the call to the appropriate implementation based on the type of the argument.

## Conclusion

Functools 동적 함수 디스패치 provides a powerful mechanism to implement polymorphism and handle different argument types in Python functions. By using the `singledispatch` decorator from the `functools` module, you can define multiple implementations of a function based on the type of the argument, allowing for more flexible and maintainable code.
