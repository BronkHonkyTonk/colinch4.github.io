In mathematics, an identity is an equality that holds true for all values of the variables. Sympy is a powerful Python library for symbolic mathematics. It provides a wide range of functionalities, including the ability to verify mathematical identities.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use Sympy to verify identities in Python. We will go through an example to illustrate the process.

## Installation

Before we begin, make sure you have Sympy installed. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install sympy
```

Alternatively, you can use the following command if you're using Anaconda:

```python
conda install -c anaconda sympy
```

## Example: Verifying the Pythagorean Identity

Let's consider the Pythagorean identity, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

We can represent the Pythagorean identity using Sympy symbols and equations. Here's how you can do it in Python:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, simplify

a, b, c = symbols('a b c')
eq = Eq(a**2 + b**2, c**2)
```

In the above code, we define three symbols `a`, `b`, and `c` using the `symbols` function from Sympy. We then define an equation `eq` using the `Eq` function, which states that `a^2 + b^2` is equal to `c^2`.

Now, let's verify the Pythagorean identity for a specific example. We can substitute numerical values for the symbols `a`, `b`, and `c` and check if the equality holds.

```python
eq_substitute = eq.subs({a: 3, b: 4, c: 5})
result = simplify(eq_substitute)

if result:
    print("The Pythagorean identity holds for the given values.")
else:
    print("The Pythagorean identity does not hold for the given values.")
```

In this code, we substitute the values `a = 3`, `b = 4`, and `c = 5` into the equation using the `subs` function. Then, we simplify the equation using the `simplify` function to check if the identity holds. If the result is True, then the Pythagorean identity holds for the given values; otherwise, it does not hold.

## Conclusion

Sympy provides a convenient way to verify mathematical identities using symbolic mathematics in Python. This allows you to perform complex mathematical calculations and validations with ease.

In this blog post, we explored how to verify the Pythagorean identity using Sympy. You can apply the same principles to other mathematical identities and equations to ensure their validity.

Sympy is extremely versatile and offers many other features. I encourage you to explore the official Sympy documentation for more information and examples.

Happy coding!
