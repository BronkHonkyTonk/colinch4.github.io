In Python, you can use the `datetime` module to work with dates and times. To obtain the current time, you can utilize the `datetime` class and its `now()` function.

Here is an example code snippet demonstrating how to get the current time in Python:

```
import datetime

# Get current time
current_time = datetime.datetime.now()

# Print current time
print("Current time is:", current_time)
```

In the above code, we first import the `datetime` module. Then, we call the `now()` function of the `datetime` class, which returns a `datetime` object representing the current date and time. We assign this object to the `current_time` variable.

Finally, we use the `print()` function to display the current time. When you run this code, the output will be similar to the following:

```
Current time is: 2022-03-15 12:34:56.789012
```

The output will vary based on the current date and time when you run the code.

By utilizing the `datetime` class and its `now()` function, you can easily obtain the current time in Python. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as logging timestamps, scheduling tasks, or time-based operations within your Python programs.
