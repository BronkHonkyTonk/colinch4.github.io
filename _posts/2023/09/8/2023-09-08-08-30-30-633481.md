In Python, the `datetime` module provides a convenient way to work with dates and times. You can format dates and times in different languages, including printing the names of months and days of the week in your desired language. Here's how you can achieve that in Python:

```python
import datetime
import locale

# Set locale to your desired language
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_TIME, 'ko_KR')  # Korean language example

# Get current date and time
now = datetime.datetime.now()

# Print the month name and weekday name
month_name = now.strftime('%B')
weekday_name = now.strftime('%A')

print(f"The current month name is {month_name}")
print(f"The current weekday name is {weekday_name}")
```

This code snippet first sets the locale to the desired language using the `locale.setlocale()` function. In this example, we set the language to Korean (`ko_KR`), but you can replace it with your preferred language. 

Next, we get the current date and time using the `datetime.datetime.now()` function. 

To print the month name, we use the `strftime()` method on the `now` object with the format specifier `%B`. This specifier returns the full month name based on the current locale.

Similarly, to print the weekday name, we use the `strftime()` method with the format specifier `%A`, which returns the full weekday name based on the locale.

Finally, we use the `print()` function to display the month name and weekday name.

By using the above code, you can easily print the month name and weekday name in your desired language using Python's `datetime` module.
