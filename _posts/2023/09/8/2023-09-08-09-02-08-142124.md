Django REST Framework (DRF) provides a powerful way to customize and define permissions for the APIs in your Python project. By default, DRF includes a set of built-in permissions such as `AllowAny`, `IsAuthenticated`, and `IsAdminUser`. However, in certain cases, you may need to implement custom permissions tailored to your specific requirements.

In this blog post, we will explore how to create and use custom permissions in DRF using Python.

## Creating a Custom Permission Class

To create a custom permission class, you need to subclass the `BasePermission` class from DRF. This class provides a set of methods that you can override to define your own permission logic.

Here's an example of a custom permission class that allows access only to authenticated users who are also superusers:

```python
from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission

class IsSuperUser(BasePermission):
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        return request.user.is_authenticated and request.user.is_superuser
```

In the `has_permission` method, you can define your own logic based on the request and the associated user. In this case, we check if the user is both authenticated and a superuser.

## Using Custom Permissions in Views

To use the custom permission class in your DRF views, you need to set the `permission_classes` attribute on your view or viewset.

```python
from rest_framework.views import APIView

class MyView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsSuperUser]
    
    def get(self, request):
        # Your view logic here
```

In this example, we set the `permission_classes` attribute to `[IsSuperUser]` to apply our custom permission class to this view. Now, only authenticated superusers will have access to this view.

You can also use multiple custom permissions or combine them with the built-in permissions provided by DRF. Simply pass a list of permission classes to the `permission_classes` attribute.

```python
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated

class MyView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsSuperUser, IsAuthenticated]
    
    def get(self, request):
        # Your view logic here
```

Here, the view will only be accessible to authenticated superusers.

## Conclusion

Custom permissions in DRF allow you to define granular access control for your APIs. By subclassing the `BasePermission` class and implementing the `has_permission` method, you can create custom permission classes to suit your project's specific requirements.

Remember to set the `permission_classes` attribute on your views or viewsets to include your custom permissions. You can also combine multiple custom permissions or use them alongside the built-in permissions provided by DRF.

With custom permissions, you can ensure that your APIs are secure and accessible only to the intended users with the necessary privileges.
