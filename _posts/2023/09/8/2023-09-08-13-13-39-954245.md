Regular expressions, or regex, are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. In Python, the `re` module provides functions and methods for working with regex. One of the key features of regex is the ability to group and capture parts of a matched pattern.

Grouping allows you to treat multiple characters as a single unit within a regular expression. This is done by enclosing the characters within parentheses `( )`. Capturing, on the other hand, allows you to extract the content of the groups for further processing.

## Syntax for Grouping and Capturing

To create a group in a regular expression, you simply enclose the desired characters or subpatterns within parentheses. For example:

```python
import re

text = "Hello, my name is John Doe"
pattern = r"(Hello), my name is (John Doe)"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
```

In the example above, `(Hello)` and `(John Doe)` are both groups that will be captured when a match is found.

## Accessing Captured Groups

Once you have a match, you can access the captured groups using the `group()` or `groups()` methods of the match object. The `group()` method returns the entire matched string, while `groups()` returns a tuple of all captured groups.

Continuing from the previous example:

```python
import re

text = "Hello, my name is John Doe"
pattern = r"(Hello), my name is (John Doe)"
match = re.search(pattern, text)

print(match.group(0))  # Output: Hello, my name is John Doe
print(match.group(1))  # Output: Hello
print(match.group(2))  # Output: John Doe
print(match.groups())  # Output: ('Hello', 'John Doe')
```

In the code above, `group(0)` returns the entire matched string, `group(1)` returns the first captured group, and `group(2)` returns the second captured group. The `groups()` method returns a tuple with all the captured groups.

## Using Captured Groups in Substitution

Captured groups can also be used in substitution operations. You can reference them using the syntax `\1`, `\2`, and so on, where the number corresponds to the group index.

```python
import re

text = "Hello, my name is John Doe"
pattern = r"(Hello), my name is (John Doe)"
replacement = r"\2, nice to meet you"

new_text = re.sub(pattern, replacement, text)
print(new_text)  # Output: John Doe, nice to meet you
```

In the example above, we use the captured group `\2` in the replacement string to modify the original text.

Regex grouping and capturing in Python provide a way to extract specific parts of a matched pattern and perform further operations on them. It is a powerful feature that enhances the flexibility and usefulness of regular expressions.
