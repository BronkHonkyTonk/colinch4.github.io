## Introduction

In today's blog post, we are going to explore how to integrate **hug** and **Celery** in Python. Both **hug** and **Celery** are powerful tools that can be used to develop efficient and scalable applications. Combining these two frameworks allows us to easily build high-performance APIs with asynchronous task execution. So, let's dive in and see how we can harness the power of both frameworks.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- pip package manager

## What is Hug?

**Hug** is a modern and lightweight Python framework for developing APIs. It aims to make building APIs as simple as possible, while still being powerful and efficient. With **hug**, you can easily define API endpoints with Python functions, making it a breeze to create and manage RESTful APIs.

## What is Celery?

**Celery** is a distributed task queue system in Python. It allows you to offload time-consuming and resource-intensive tasks to worker processes, freeing up your main application to handle other requests. **Celery** supports both synchronous and asynchronous task execution, making it suitable for building scalable applications.

## Integrating Hug and Celery

To integrate **hug** and **Celery**, we need to use **Celery** as the task execution engine for asynchronous tasks in our **hug** API. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. **Install the required libraries**: Open your terminal or command prompt and install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

```python
pip install hug celery
```

2. **Create a Celery configuration file**: Create a new file called `celeryconfig.py` and add the following content to it:

```python

broker_url = 'amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//'
result_backend = 'rpc://'

imports = (
    'myapp.tasks',
)

```

Make sure to replace `myapp.tasks` with the actual path to your tasks module.

3. **Define your tasks**: Create a new file called `tasks.py` and define your Celery tasks. Here's an example of a simple task:

```python
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('tasks')
app.config_from_object('celeryconfig')

@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

4. **Create your Hug API**: Now, let's create a new file called `api.py` and define our **hug** API. It should import the **Celery** tasks module and use its tasks as needed. Here's an example of a basic **hug** API with **Celery** integration:

```python

import hug
from myapp.tasks import add

@hug.get('/add')
def add_numbers(x: int, y: int):
    result = add.delay(x, y)
    return {'task_id': result.id}

```

5. **Start the Celery worker**: Open a new terminal or command prompt window and start the Celery worker by running the following command:

```python
celery -A celeryconfig worker --loglevel=info
```

6. **Start the Hug API**: In another terminal or command prompt window, start the **hug** API server by running the following command:

```python
hug -f api.py
```

That's it! Your **hug** API is now integrated with **Celery** for asynchronous task execution. You can now send requests to your API endpoints and let **Celery** handle the heavy lifting.

## Summary

In this blog post, we explored how to integrate **hug** and **Celery** in Python to build high-performance APIs with asynchronous task execution. By combining the simplicity of **hug** with the power of **Celery**, we can develop scalable applications that handle time-consuming tasks efficiently. So go ahead, try out this integration in your next project and see the difference it makes!
