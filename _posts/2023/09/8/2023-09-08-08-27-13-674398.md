Python's `datetime` module provides powerful tools for working with dates and times. In this blog post, we will learn how to calculate the start and end dates of a specific week (주) using the `datetime` module.

## Calculating the start and end dates of a week

To calculate the start and end dates of a week, we need to know the year, week number, and the day of the week that we want the week to start. For example, we might want to calculate the start and end dates of the 10th week of the year, starting from Monday.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to calculate the start and end dates of a specific week:

```python
import datetime

def get_week_start_end_dates(year, week_number, start_day_of_week):
    # Set the start day of the week (0 = Monday, 1 = Tuesday, ..., 6 = Sunday)
    start_day = datetime.timedelta(days=(start_day_of_week + 1) % 7)

    # Calculate the starting date of the week
    start_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(f'{year}-W{week_number-1}-{start_day}', "%Y-W%W-%w")

    # Calculate the ending date of the week
    end_date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(days=6)

    return start_date, end_date

# Example usage
year = 2022
week_number = 10
start_day_of_week = 0  # 0 = Monday

start_date, end_date = get_week_start_end_dates(year, week_number, start_day_of_week)

print(f"The start date of week {week_number} is {start_date.date()}")
print(f"The end date of week {week_number} is {end_date.date()}")
```

## Explanation

- We start by defining the `get_week_start_end_dates` function that takes the `year`, `week_number`, and `start_day_of_week` as parameters.
- We calculate the starting date of the week by using `datetime.strptime`, which allows us to parse a date string based on a specific format. In this case, we use the format `"%Y-W%W-%w"` to specify the ISO week-based year, week number, and day of the week.
- We then add 6 days to the starting date to calculate the ending date of the week.
- Finally, we return the start and end dates as a tuple.

In the example usage, we set the `year` to 2022, `week_number` to 10, and `start_day_of_week` to 0 (Monday). When we run the code, we get the following output:

```
The start date of week 10 is 2022-03-07
The end date of week 10 is 2022-03-13
```

## Conclusion

Calculating the start and end dates of a week can be useful in various applications, such as task scheduling, data analysis, and reporting. With the help of Python's `datetime` module, we can easily perform these calculations. The example code provided in this blog post serves as a starting point for implementing this functionality in your own projects.
