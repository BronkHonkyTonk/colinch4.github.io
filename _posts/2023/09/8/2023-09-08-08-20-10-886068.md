Logging is an essential part of software development as it allows developers to track and analyze various events and errors that occur during runtime. In Python, the logging module provides a flexible and powerful way to incorporate logging into your applications.

In this blog post, we will explore how to create and configure a logging logger object in Python.

## Logger Object

The `Logger` class is the central component of the logging module. It is responsible for tracking and storing log records.

To create a logger object, you first need to import the logging module:

```python
import logging
```

Then, you can create a logger object by calling the `getLogger()` method:

```python
logger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')
```

In the example above, we created a logger object named 'my_logger'. The name can be any string value and is used to identify the logger throughout the application.

## Logging Levels

Now that we have created a logger object, we can set the logging level. The logging level determines the severity of the messages that will be logged.

Logging levels in Python are defined as integers, and the logging module provides several predefined levels:

- `logging.DEBUG` (10)
- `logging.INFO` (20)
- `logging.WARNING` (30)
- `logging.ERROR` (40)
- `logging.CRITICAL` (50)

To set the logging level of a logger object, you can use the `setLevel()` method:

```python
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
```

In the example above, we set the logging level to `logging.INFO`, which means that only messages with a severity level of INFO or higher will be logged.

## Logging Handlers

After setting the logging level, we need to configure a logging handler. The handler determines where the log messages will be stored or displayed.

There are several types of handlers available in the logging module, including the `StreamHandler`, `FileHandler`, `RotatingFileHandler`, and more.

In this example, we will use the `StreamHandler` to log messages to the console:

```python
handler = logging.StreamHandler()
handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
logger.addHandler(handler)
```

In the code above, we create a `StreamHandler` object and set its logging level to `logging.INFO`. We then add the handler to the logger by calling the `addHandler()` method.

Logging Messages

Now that we have created and configured our logger object, we can start logging messages.

To log a message, we can use the logging methods provided by the logger object, such as `debug()`, `info()`, `warning()`, `error()`, and `critical()`:

```python
logger.info('This is an informational message')
logger.warning('This is a warning message')
logger.error('This is an error message')
```

In the example above, we log messages with different severity levels using the respective logging methods.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to create and configure a logging logger object in Python. We discussed the importance of logging in software development and explored the different logging levels and handlers available.

By properly configuring logging in your applications, you can easily track and analyze events and errors, making it easier to debug and maintain your code.
