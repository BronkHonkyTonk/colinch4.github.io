In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate Airflow with SOAP APIs in Python. Airflow is a popular open-source platform used for orchestrating, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) APIs are widely used for web service communication, particularly in enterprise applications.

## What is SOAP API?

SOAP is a protocol that allows programs running on different operating systems to communicate with each other by using Extensible Markup Language (XML). SOAP APIs provide a standardized set of rules for exchanging structured information between web services.

## Why use Airflow for SOAP API integration?

Airflow offers several advantages for integrating SOAP APIs into your workflow:

1. **Workflow orchestration:** Airflow provides a powerful and flexible workflow management system, allowing you to create complex workflows with dependencies, retries, and scheduling.

2. **Distributed execution:** Airflow supports distributed execution of tasks, allowing you to scale your SOAP API integrations as needed.

3. **Monitoring and alerting:** Airflow provides built-in monitoring and alerting capabilities, allowing you to track the status of your SOAP API tasks and receive notifications in case of failures.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed
- Airflow installed (`pip install apache-airflow`)
- SOAP API WSDL (Web Service Description Language) file

## Integration Steps

1. **Set up an Airflow project:** Start by setting up a new Airflow project or use an existing one. You can follow the [official Airflow documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/) for more details on project setup.

2. **Create a Python script:** Create a new Python script file, e.g., `soap_api_integration.py`, inside the Airflow project directory.

3. **Import required modules:** At the start of your script, import the necessary modules:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
import zeep
```

4. **Define a function for SOAP API call:** Create a function that encapsulates the logic for making the SOAP API call. You can use the `zeep` library in Python for making SOAP requests. Here is an example:

```python
def call_soap_api():
    wsdl_url = "http://example.com/soap_api?wsdl"
    client = zeep.Client(wsdl=wsdl_url)
    result = client.service.some_operation()
    print(result)
```

Replace `wsdl_url` with the actual URL of your SOAP API WSDL file and `some_operation()` with the specific operation you want to call.

5. **Create a DAG:** In Airflow, a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) defines a workflow. Define a new DAG object with a unique identifier and schedule interval. Here is an example:

```python
dag = DAG(
    'soap_api_integration',
    start_date=datetime.datetime.now(),
    schedule_interval='0 0 * * *'
)
```

Replace `soap_api_integration` with your desired DAG ID and modify the `start_date` and `schedule_interval` as per your requirements.

6. **Add a task:** Add a PythonOperator task to the DAG, which will execute the SOAP API call function. Here is an example:

```python
soap_api_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='call_soap_api',
    python_callable=call_soap_api,
    dag=dag
)
```

7. **Run the DAG:** Save the script file and run the Airflow scheduler. This will start executing the DAG according to the defined schedule.

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated Airflow with SOAP APIs in Python. Now, you can monitor the execution status and logs of your SOAP API tasks through the Airflow UI.

## Conclusion

Airflow provides a convenient way to integrate SOAP APIs into your workflows. With Airflow's workflow orchestration, distributed execution, and monitoring capabilities, you can easily automate and manage your SOAP API integrations.
