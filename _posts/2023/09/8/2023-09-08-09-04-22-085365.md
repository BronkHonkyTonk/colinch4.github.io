API version management is an important aspect of developing and maintaining a scalable and stable RESTful API. **Django Rest Framework (DRF)** provides a robust way to manage API versions in Python. In this blog post, we will explore different strategies to handle API versioning using DRF.

## Why API Versioning is important?

API versioning allows you to make changes to your API without breaking the existing functionality for the clients currently using it. As your API evolves and improves over time, you may introduce changes that are not backward compatible. Without proper versioning, these changes will impact existing clients and potentially break their functionality.

## Different Strategies for API Versioning in DRF

### 1. URL Versioning

URL versioning involves including the desired version number in the URL itself. For example, `website.com/api/v1/` or `website.com/api/v2/`. This approach allows clients to explicitly specify the version they want to use.

To implement URL versioning in DRF, you can make use of the `urls.py` file in your Django project. Define different URL patterns for each version of your API.

Example code:

```python
# urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import MyAPIView_v1, MyAPIView_v2

urlpatterns = [
    path('api/v1/', MyAPIView_v1.as_view()),
    path('api/v2/', MyAPIView_v2.as_view()),
]
```

### 2. Header Versioning

Header versioning involves passing the version information in the request headers. With this approach, the URL remains the same for all versions of the API, and the version information is extracted from the request headers.

To implement header versioning in DRF, you can create a custom class that inherits from `URLPattern` and override the `resolve` method to extract the version from the request headers.

Example code:

```python
# urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import MyAPIView

urlpatterns = [
    path('api/', MyAPIView.as_view()),
]
```

```python
# custom_urls.py
from django.urls import URLPattern
from django.utils.functional import cached_property

class HeaderVersionedURLPattern(URLPattern):
    @cached_property
    def callback(self):
        return self.callback_class.as_view()

    def resolve(self, path):
        request = self.callback.request
        version = request.headers.get('Accept-Version')
        
        if version == 'v1':
            self.callback_class = MyAPIView_v1
        elif version == 'v2':
            self.callback_class = MyAPIView_v2

        return super().resolve(path)
```

### 3. Query Parameter Versioning

In query parameter versioning, the version information is passed as a query parameter in the URL. For example, `website.com/api/?version=v1` or `website.com/api/?version=v2`.

To implement query parameter versioning in DRF, you can make use of the built-in `URLPathVersioning` class provided by DRF.

Example code:

```python
# settings.py
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_VERSIONING_CLASS': 'rest_framework.versioning.URLPathVersioning',
    'DEFAULT_VERSION': 'v1',
    'ALLOWED_VERSIONS': ['v1', 'v2'],
}
```

```python
# urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import MyAPIView

urlpatterns = [
    path('api/', MyAPIView.as_view()),
]
```

## Conclusion

Properly managing API versions ensures backward compatibility and provides a smooth transition when introducing changes to your API. Django Rest Framework makes it easy to implement different versioning strategies, including URL versioning, header versioning, and query parameter versioning.

By following these best practices, you can create robust and scalable APIs that can adapt to evolving requirements without breaking existing client functionality.
