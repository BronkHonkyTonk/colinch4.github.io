Logging is an important aspect of any software application. It helps developers track and analyze the behavior of their code during runtime. Python provides a built-in logging module that simplifies the process of logging messages. However, sometimes the default log message format may not meet our requirements. In this blog post, we will explore how to customize log messages in Python.

## Before Customization: Default Log Message Format

When using the logging module in Python, the default log message format is:

`[levelname] : [asctime] : [module] : [message]`

- `[levelname]`: Indicates the level of the log message (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
- `[asctime]`: Timestamp of the log message.
- `[module]`: Name of the module from which the log message is emitted.
- `[message]`: Content of the log message.

## Customizing the Log Message Format

The logging module provides a powerful feature to customize the format of log messages. We can use the `basicConfig()` method to set the desired log format. Let's take a look at an example:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    format='%(levelname)s : %(asctime)s : %(message)s',
    level=logging.INFO
)

logging.info("Customized log message")
```

In the above code snippet, we are using the `basicConfig()` method to set the log message format. The format string contains placeholders surrounded by `%` signs, which are replaced with the relevant values when logging a message.

- `%(levelname)s`: Represents the log level.
- `%(asctime)s`: Represents the timestamp of the log message.
- `%(message)s`: Represents the content of the log message.

## Additional Formatting Options

In addition to the basic placeholders, the format string can include additional formatting options. Here are some commonly used ones:

- `%(name)s`: Name of the logger.
- `%(module)s`: Name of the module.
- `%(lineno)d`: Line number from where the log message is emitted.
- `%(filename)s`: Name of the file from which the log message is emitted.
- `%(funcName)s`: Name of the function from which the log message is emitted.

## Custom Log Handlers

Apart from customizing the log message format, the logging module also allows us to define custom log handlers. This allows us to redirect log messages to different destinations such as files, console, or external services.

By subclassing the `logging.Handler` class, we can create our own custom log handler and define how the log messages should be handled. For more information on creating custom log handlers, refer to the official Python documentation.

## Conclusion

Logging is an essential part of any software application, allowing developers to effectively track and debug their code. Python's logging module provides a convenient way to log messages, and customizing the log message format gives us more control over the output. By utilizing these customization techniques, we can tailor the logging experience based on our specific requirements.
