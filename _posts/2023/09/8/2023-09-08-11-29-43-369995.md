In this blog post, we will explore how to build a data workflow using CSV files in Python. CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a popular file format for storing tabular data. With Python's built-in `csv` library, we can easily read and write data from and to CSV files, making it a powerful tool for data processing and analysis tasks.

## Reading Data from CSV

To start, let's look at how we can read data from a CSV file. Suppose we have a file named `data.csv` with the following contents:

```csv
name,age,email
John Doe,25,johndoe@example.com
Jane Smith,30,janesmith@example.com
```

To read this data into a Python program, we can use the `csv.reader` class. Here's an example:

```python
import csv

# Open the CSV file
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    # Create a reader object
    reader = csv.reader(file)

    # Iterate over each row in the CSV file
    for row in reader:
        # Print each row
        print(row)
```

Running this code will output:

```
['name', 'age', 'email']
['John Doe', '25', 'johndoe@example.com']
['Jane Smith', '30', 'janesmith@example.com']
```

## Writing Data to CSV

Now, let's see how we can write data to a CSV file. Suppose we have a list of dictionaries representing data that we want to write to a file. Here's an example:

```python
import csv

data = [
    {'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 25, 'email': 'johndoe@example.com'},
    {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'age': 30, 'email': 'janesmith@example.com'}
]

# Open a new CSV file in write mode
with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    # Create a writer object
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=data[0].keys())

    # Write the header
    writer.writeheader()

    # Write each row of data
    for row in data:
        writer.writerow(row)
```

Running this code will create a new file named `output.csv` with the following contents:

```csv
name,age,email
John Doe,25,johndoe@example.com
Jane Smith,30,janesmith@example.com
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to build a data workflow using CSV files in Python. We explored how to read data from CSV using `csv.reader` and how to write data to CSV using `csv.DictWriter`. CSV files provide a simple and efficient way to work with tabular data in Python, making them a valuable tool for data processing tasks.
