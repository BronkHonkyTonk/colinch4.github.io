In Python, the `functools` module provides several useful functions for working with higher-order functions and function decorators. 

One of the constants defined in the `functools` module is `WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS`. This constant is a tuple of strings that specifies the names of attributes that should be assigned directly from the original function to the wrapper function when using the `functools.wraps` decorator.

The `functools.wraps` decorator is commonly used to create a decorator that preserves the original function's name, docstring, and other metadata. When decorating a function with `functools.wraps`, the `WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS` constant can be used to specify which attributes should be assigned from the original function to the wrapper function.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `functools.WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS`:

```python
from functools import wraps, WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func, assigned=WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Do some preprocessing before calling the original function
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # Do some postprocessing after calling the original function
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def my_function():
    """This is my function."""
    pass

print(my_function.__name__)  # Output: my_function
print(my_function.__doc__)   # Output: This is my function.
```

In the above example, we define a decorator `my_decorator` that wraps a function. By using `functools.wraps` with `assigned=WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS`, we ensure that attributes like `__name__` and `__doc__` are properly assigned from the original function to the wrapper function. This helps in preserving the metadata of the original function.

By using `functools.WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS`, you can create decorators that not only modify the behavior of a function but also preserve its important attributes.

Remember to import `functools` and the `WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS` constant before using them in your code.

That's all for this blog post! I hope you found it helpful in understanding how to use `functools.WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS` in Python. Happy coding!
