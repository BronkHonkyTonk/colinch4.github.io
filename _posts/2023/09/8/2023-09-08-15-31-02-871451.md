In Python, the `pathlib` module provides an object-oriented approach to handle file system paths. It offers various methods to manipulate paths, including `Path.with_name()` and `Path.with_suffix()`. These methods allow you to modify the name and the extension of a path, respectively.

## `Path.with_name()`

The `Path.with_name()` method creates a new `Path` object with the given filename, replacing the original filename of the path. This method does not modify the original `Path` object but instead returns a new one.

```python
from pathlib import Path

file_path = Path("/path/to/file.txt")
new_path = file_path.with_name("new_file.txt")

print(file_path)  # Output: /path/to/file.txt
print(new_path)   # Output: /path/to/new_file.txt
```

In the example above, `with_name("new_file.txt")` creates a new `Path` object with the filename "new_file.txt" while keeping the original directory and file extension intact.

## `Path.with_suffix()`

The `Path.with_suffix()` method replaces the file extension of a path with the given suffix. This method, similar to `Path.with_name()`, returns a new `Path` object with the modified extension.

```python
from pathlib import Path

file_path = Path("/path/to/file.txt")
new_path = file_path.with_suffix(".csv")

print(file_path)  # Output: /path/to/file.txt
print(new_path)   # Output: /path/to/file.csv
```

In the code excerpt above, `with_suffix(".csv")` replaces the file extension of the `Path` object with ".csv" and returns a new `Path` object.

## Conclusion

The `Path.with_name()` and `Path.with_suffix()` methods in Python's `pathlib` module provide convenient ways to modify the filename and file extension of a path, respectively. By utilizing these methods, you can manipulate paths easily and efficiently in your Python code.
