In Apache Airflow, sensors are used to wait for a certain condition to be met before allowing a task to proceed. While there are several built-in sensors in Airflow, there may be cases where you need to create custom sensors to meet your specific requirements.

In this blog post, we will guide you on how to create custom sensors in Airflow using Python.

## Steps to create a custom sensor

### Step 1: Create a Python file

Create a new Python file in your Airflow project directory. Let's name it `custom_sensor.py`. This file will contain the code for your custom sensor.

### Step 2: Import necessary packages

In the `custom_sensor.py` file, import the necessary packages required for creating a custom sensor. Below is an example of the most commonly used packages:

```python
from airflow.sensors.base import BaseSensorOperator
from airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults
```

### Step 3: Define your custom sensor class

Create a class for your custom sensor that extends the `BaseSensorOperator` class. The `BaseSensorOperator` provides the basic functionality for a sensor in Airflow. Below is an example of a custom sensor class:

```python
class CustomSensor(BaseSensorOperator):

    @apply_defaults
    def __init__(self, my_param, *args, **kwargs):
        super(CustomSensor, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.my_param = my_param

    def poke(self, context):
        """
        Define the logic to determine the success or failure of the sensor.
        The `poke` method will be called repeatedly until it returns `True`.
        """
        # Place your sensor logic here
        if self.my_param == 'success':
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Step 4: Implement the `poke` method

In the `poke` method of your custom sensor class, implement the logic to determine the success or failure of the sensor. The `poke` method will be called repeatedly until it returns `True`. You can use any logic based on your specific requirements.

### Step 5: Use your custom sensor in a DAG

Once your custom sensor class is defined, you can use it in your Airflow DAGs by instantiating an object of the custom sensor class. Below is an example of how to use your custom sensor in a DAG:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from custom_sensor import CustomSensor

dag = DAG('my_dag', description='Example DAG', schedule_interval='@daily')

custom_sensor_task = CustomSensor(
    my_param='success',
    task_id='custom_sensor_task',
    dag=dag
)
```

In the above example, the `CustomSensor` is instantiated with the `my_param` parameter set to `'success'`.

## Conclusion

Creating custom sensors in Airflow allows you to build more advanced workflows by incorporating your own logic to determine when a task can proceed. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily create and use your own custom sensors in your Airflow projects.

Happy Airflow-ing!
