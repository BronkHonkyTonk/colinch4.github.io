In this blog post, we will explore different regular expression patterns that can be used to match and validate various protocols and schemas in Python. Specifically, we will focus on patterns for popular protocols such as HTTP and FTP.

## HTTP URL Pattern

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents over the internet. The following regex pattern can be used to validate and extract information from an HTTP URL:

```python
import re

url = "https://www.example.com"
pattern = r'^(https?)://([\w.-]+)(:\d+)?(/.*)?$'

match = re.match(pattern, url)
if match:
    protocol = match.group(1)
    domain = match.group(2)
    port = match.group(3) or ""
    path = match.group(4) or "/"

    print(f"Protocol: {protocol}")
    print(f"Domain: {domain}")
    print(f"Port: {port}")
    print(f"Path: {path}")
else:
    print("Invalid URL")
```

Output:
```
Protocol: https
Domain: www.example.com
Port:
Path: /

Explanation:
- `^` matches the start of the string.
- `(https?)` matches either "http" or "https" as a capturing group.
- `://` matches the literal characters "://".
- `([\w.-]+)` matches one or more word characters, dots, or hyphens as a capturing group (to match the domain).
- `(:\d+)?` matches an optional port number prefixed with a colon (e.g., ":8080").
- `(/.*)?` matches an optional path starting with a slash (e.g., "/path/to/resource").
- `$` matches the end of the string.

## FTP URL Pattern

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used for transferring files from one host to another. The following regex pattern can be used to validate and extract information from an FTP URL:

```python
import re

url = "ftp://ftp.example.com:21/files"
pattern = r'^ftp://([\w.-]+)(:\d+)?(/.*)?$'

match = re.match(pattern, url)
if match:
    domain = match.group(1)
    port = match.group(2) or ""
    path = match.group(3) or "/"

    print(f"Domain: {domain}")
    print(f"Port: {port}")
    print(f"Path: {path}")
else:
    print("Invalid URL")
```

Output:
```
Domain: ftp.example.com
Port: :21
Path: /files

Explanation:
- `^` matches the start of the string.
- `ftp://` matches the literal characters "ftp://".
- `([\w.-]+)` matches one or more word characters, dots, or hyphens as a capturing group (to match the domain).
- `(:\d+)?` matches an optional port number prefixed with a colon (e.g., ":21").
- `(/.*)?` matches an optional path starting with a slash (e.g., "/files").
- `$` matches the end of the string.

By using regular expression patterns like these, you can easily validate and extract information from URLs that follow specific protocols or schemas. Regex is a powerful tool for pattern matching and can greatly simplify processing and manipulation of text data in Python.
