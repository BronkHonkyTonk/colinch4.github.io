In Python, decorators are a powerful feature that allows you to add additional functionality to a function or class. With decorators, you can modify the behavior of the decorated object without directly modifying its source code. One of the handy features that Python offers is the ability to chain multiple decorators together using `functools`.

## What are decorators?

Decorators are simply functions that wrap another function or class, modifying its behavior. They are called with the original function or class as an argument and return a new modified function or class. Decorators are prefixed with the `@` symbol when applied to a function or class.

## Why use decorator chaining?

Decorator chaining allows you to apply multiple decorators to a function or class, one after the other. Each decorator can add its own behavior or modify the behavior added by the previous decorator. This provides a convenient way to add modular and reusable functionality to your codebase.

## How to chain decorators using functools?

The `functools` module in the Python standard library provides a function called `wraps` that simplifies the chaining of decorators. The `wraps` function is used as a decorator to preserve the original function's metadata (such as name, docstring, etc.) when creating new decorated functions.

To chain decorators, you need to apply the decorators starting from the innermost one and working your way outwards. This can be achieved by using the `@decorator` syntax multiple times, with each decorator wrapping the next one.

Here is an example that demonstrates decorator chaining using `functools`:

```python
import functools

def decorator1(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Add behavior before calling the original function
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # Add behavior after the original function returns
        return result
    return wrapper

def decorator2(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Add behavior before calling the original function
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # Add behavior after the original function returns
        return result
    return wrapper

@decorator1
@decorator2
def my_function():
    # Original function logic goes here
    pass
```

In the above example, `decorator1` and `decorator2` are two simple decorators that add behavior before and after the original function `my_function` is called. When `my_function` is invoked, the decorators are applied in reverse order. First, `decorator2` wraps `my_function`, and then `decorator1` wraps the result of `decorator2`.

Note that `functools.wraps` is used in each decorator to preserve the metadata of the original function. This ensures that the modified function inherits the name, docstring, and other attributes of the original function.

## Conclusion

Decorator chaining using `functools` provides a convenient way to add additional functionality to a function or class. By applying multiple decorators one after the other, you can modularize and reuse different behaviors as needed. The `functools.wraps` function helps preserve the original function's metadata when creating decorated functions.

Decorators and decorator chaining can be powerful tools in your Python toolbox, helping you write cleaner, more concise, and more maintainable code.
