Python's `pathlib` module is a powerful library for handling file system paths and operations in a platform-independent way. In this blog post, we will explore how to use `pathlib` to check the size of a file.

## Getting started

To begin, we need to import the `Path` class from the `pathlib` module. The `Path` class represents a file or directory path.

```python
from pathlib import Path
```

Next, let's define the path to the file we want to check the size of. In this example, we will assume the file is located in the same directory as our Python script.

```python
file_path = Path("example.txt")
```

## Checking the file size

To check the size of the file, we can use the `Path.stat()` method, which returns a `os.stat_result` object with various file attributes, including the size.

```python
file_size = file_path.stat().st_size
```

The `st_size` attribute of the `stat_result` object represents the size of the file in bytes.

## Formatting the file size

We can convert the file size from bytes to a more human-readable format, such as kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes. Here's an example function that formats the file size:

```python
def format_file_size(size_in_bytes):
    for unit in ["B", "KB", "MB", "GB"]:
        if size_in_bytes < 1024:
            return f"{size_in_bytes:.2f} {unit}"
        size_in_bytes /= 1024
```

Now, let's call the `format_file_size` function with our file size in bytes:

```python
formatted_size = format_file_size(file_size)
```

This will give us the file size in a human-readable format, such as "1.23 KB" or "4.56 MB".

## Putting it all together

Here's the complete code that checks the size of a file using `pathlib` and formats the file size:

```python
from pathlib import Path

def format_file_size(size_in_bytes):
    for unit in ["B", "KB", "MB", "GB"]:
        if size_in_bytes < 1024:
            return f"{size_in_bytes:.2f} {unit}"
        size_in_bytes /= 1024

file_path = Path("example.txt")
file_size = file_path.stat().st_size
formatted_size = format_file_size(file_size)

print(f"The size of the file is {formatted_size}.")
```

## Wrap up

In this blog post, we have learned how to check the size of a file using `pathlib` in Python. The `Path` class provides a convenient and platform-independent way to work with file paths. The `stat()` method allows us to access various file attributes, including the size. By formatting the file size, we can easily present it in a human-readable format.
