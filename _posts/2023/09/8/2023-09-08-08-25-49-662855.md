In Python, you can easily check whether a specific year is a leap year or not by using the `datetime` module. A leap year is a year that is exactly divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years (years ending in 00) unless they are also divisible by 400.

Let's go ahead and write a simple Python code to confirm whether a given year is a leap year or not.

```python
import datetime

def is_leap_year(year):
    if year % 4 == 0:
        if year % 100 == 0:
            if year % 400 == 0:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            return True
    else:
        return False

# Prompt the user to enter a year
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# Check if the year is a leap year
if is_leap_year(year):
    print(f"{year} is a leap year!")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year!")
```

The `is_leap_year()` function takes a year as input and returns `True` if it is a leap year, and `False` otherwise. The algorithm follows the rules mentioned earlier:

- If the year is divisible by 4, then it could be a leap year.
- If the year is divisible by 100, then it is only a leap year if it is also divisible by 400.
- If the year is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year.

We prompt the user to enter a year using the `input()` function and convert it to an integer using `int()`. Finally, we display the result based on the return value of the `is_leap_year()` function.

Feel free to run this code and check if any given year is a leap year or not.

Happy coding!
