FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

One powerful feature of FastAPI is its ability to handle **streaming responses**. Streaming responses allow you to send data to the client in a continuous stream, rather than waiting for the entire response payload to be generated before sending it.

This is particularly useful in scenarios where you have a long-running process or need to stream large amounts of data to the client, such as real-time updates, live video feeds, or large file downloads.

## Setting Up FastAPI

Before we dive into streaming responses, let's set up a basic FastAPI application.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

Here, we define a simple endpoint that returns a JSON response when a GET request is made to the base URL (`/`).

## Streaming Responses with FastAPI

To enable streaming responses in FastAPI, we can make use of the `StreamingResponse` class provided by the `fastapi.responses` module.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/stream")
async def stream_response():
    async def generate_data():
        for i in range(10):
            yield f"Streaming data {i}\n"
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
    
    return StreamingResponse(generate_data())
```

In the example above, we define a new endpoint `/stream`, which will return a streaming response.

The `generate_data()` function is an asynchronous generator that yields chunks of data to be streamed. In this case, we simply yield a string with the iteration number and a newline character. We also introduce a one-second delay between each iteration using `asyncio.sleep()`, just for demonstration purposes.

The `StreamingResponse()` function takes the `generate_data()` generator as its argument and returns a streaming response object.

## Handling the Streaming Response

Now, let's test the streaming response using an HTTP client, such as `curl`.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8000/stream
```

You will observe that the response is streamed back to the client one chunk at a time, with a one-second delay between each chunk. This allows the client to process the data as it arrives, instead of waiting for the entire payload.

## Conclusion

FastAPI's support for streaming responses allows you to build efficient and responsive APIs that can stream data in real-time. This can be particularly useful for scenarios where you need to send continuous updates or transmit large amounts of data.

In this blog post, we covered the basics of setting up a FastAPI application and demonstrated how to implement streaming responses using the `StreamingResponse` class.

Now that you have an understanding of how to use streaming responses in FastAPI, you can start leveraging this functionality in your own projects to build high-performance, real-time applications.
