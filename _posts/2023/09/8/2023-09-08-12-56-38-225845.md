In this blog post, we will explore the concept of the Hilbert Transform and its inverse transform using the mpmath library in Python. The Hilbert Transform is a mathematical operation that is widely used in signal processing and mathematics, particularly in the field of complex analysis.

## Introduction to the Hilbert Transform

The Hilbert Transform is an integral transform that maps a function of time to a new function of time. It is defined by the following equation:

![Hilbert Transform Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5CHuge%20H%7Bf%7Dt%5C%20%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cpi%7D%20P.V.%20%5Cint_%7B-%5Cinfty%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%5Cfrac%7Bf%28%5Ctau%29%7D%7Bt-%5Ctau%7D%20d%5Ctau)

where H{f}(t) is the Hilbert Transform of the function f(t), P.V. represents the Cauchy Principal Value, and the integral is taken over the entire real line.

The Hilbert Transform has the interesting property of shifting the phase of a signal by 90 degrees, effectively creating an analytic signal from a real-valued signal. This makes it useful in various applications such as modulation, demodulation, and signal analysis.

## Using mpmath for Hilbert Transform

To compute the Hilbert Transform and its inverse transformation, we can leverage the power of the mpmath library in Python. mpmath is a Python library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic that provides functions for mathematical operations with high precision.

To get started, we need to install the mpmath library using pip:

```python
pip install mpmath
```

Now, let's import the necessary libraries and define a sample function to demonstrate the Hilbert Transform:

```python
import mpmath

# Define a sample function
def f(t):
    return mpmath.exp(-t**2/2)
```

Next, we can compute the Hilbert Transform using the `hankel1` function from mpmath:

```python
# Compute the Hilbert Transform
h = mpmath.hankel1(0, t)
```

Similarly, we can compute the inverse transformation using the `hankel2` function:

```python
# Compute the inverse transformation
f_inv = mpmath.hankel2(0, t)
```

Finally, we can plot the original function and its transformed versions using matplotlib:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate time values
t = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)

# Compute the original function
f_vals = [f(ti) for ti in t]

# Compute the Hilbert Transform
h_vals = [hankel1(0, ti) for ti in t]

# Compute the inverse transformation
f_inv_vals = [hankel2(0, ti) for ti in t]

# Plot the results
plt.plot(t, f_vals, label='Original Function')
plt.plot(t, h_vals, label='Hilbert Transform')
plt.plot(t, f_inv_vals, label='Inverse Transform')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

You should now see a plot with three curves representing the original function, the Hilbert Transform, and the inverse transform.

In conclusion, the mpmath library in Python provides us with a convenient way to compute the Hilbert Transform and its inverse transformation. This powerful tool opens up possibilities for various applications in signal processing and mathematics. Explore and experiment with the Hilbert Transform to uncover its potential in your own projects!
