Sympy is a powerful Python library for symbolic mathematics. It provides various tools and functionalities for working with mathematical expressions, equations, and sets. In this blog post, we will explore how to use Sympy to perform set operations such as `Union` and `Intersection`.

## Getting Started

Before we dive into the set operations, let's make sure we have Sympy installed. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install sympy
```

Once Sympy is installed, we can start using it in our Python code.

## Creating Sets

First, let's create two sets that we will use for our set operations:

```python
from sympy import FiniteSet

set1 = FiniteSet(1, 2, 3, 4)  # Set containing elements 1, 2, 3, 4
set2 = FiniteSet(3, 4, 5, 6)  # Set containing elements 3, 4, 5, 6
```

Here, we have created `set1` and `set2` using the `FiniteSet` class provided by Sympy. You can replace the elements with your own values or add more elements as per your requirements.

## Union of Sets

The `Union` operation combines two sets and returns a new set that contains all the elements from both sets, without any duplicates.

```python
from sympy import Union

union_set = Union(set1, set2)  # Perform union operation

print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
```

In the above code snippet, we use the `Union` class provided by Sympy to perform the union operation on `set1` and `set2`. The result is stored in the variable `union_set`, which contains all the elements from both sets.

## Intersection of Sets

The `Intersection` operation returns a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets.

```python
from sympy import Intersection

intersection_set = Intersection(set1, set2)  # Perform intersection operation

print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3, 4}
```

In the above code snippet, we use the `Intersection` class provided by Sympy to perform the intersection operation on `set1` and `set2`. The result is stored in the variable `intersection_set`, which contains only the common elements from both sets.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to perform set operations like `Union` and `Intersection` using the Sympy library in Python. Sympy provides a rich set of functionalities for working with mathematical expressions and sets. You can further explore Sympy's documentation to learn more about its capabilities and use cases.

Remember to import the necessary Sympy classes, create sets using the `FiniteSet` class, and use the `Union` and `Intersection` classes to perform the set operations.
