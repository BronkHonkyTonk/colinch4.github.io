API documentation is an essential part of any software project, as it provides a clear understanding of the available endpoints, request formats, response structures, and possible error codes. In this blog post, we will explore how to effectively document Hug APIs in Python.

## Why document Hug APIs?

Documenting Hug APIs is crucial for ensuring maintainability, collaboration, and ease of use. Well-documented APIs provide developers with the necessary information on how to interact with the endpoints, reducing confusion and potential mistakes.

## Choosing a Documentation Tool

To document Hug APIs, we can leverage various documentation tools. Some popular choices include:

- **Swagger/OpenAPI:** Swagger is a widely used API documentation framework that allows you to design, build, and document RESTful APIs. It provides interactive documentation and code generation capabilities.
- **Sphinx:** Sphinx is a powerful documentation tool commonly used for documenting Python projects. It supports various output formats, including HTML, PDF, and ePub.
- **Markdown:** Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to write and read. It can be combined with other tools to generate beautiful documentation.

In this blog post, we will focus on using Markdown to document Hug APIs.

## Documenting Hug APIs with Markdown

### 1. Endpoint Description

Start by documenting the purpose and functionality of your API endpoints. Clearly describe what the endpoint does, what resources it interacts with, and any specific requirements or limitations.

For example:

```python
@hug.get('/users/{user_id}')
def get_user(user_id: hug.types.number):
    '''
    Get user by ID

    Retrieves user information based on the provided user ID.

    :param user_id: The ID of the user
    :return: User information including name, email, and address
    '''
    user = get_user_from_database(user_id)
    return user
```

### 2. Request Parameters

Next, document the expected request parameters, including their data type and whether they are required or optional.

For example:

```python
@hug.get('/users')
def get_users(page: hug.types.number = 1, limit: hug.types.number = 10):
    '''
    Get a list of users

    Retrieves a paginated list of users.

    :param page: The page number to fetch (default: 1)
    :param limit: The number of users per page (default: 10)
    :return: A list of users
    '''
    users = get_users_from_database(page, limit)
    return users
```

### 3. Response Structure

Document the structure of the response object, including the data type of each field.

For example:

```python
@hug.get('/users')
def get_users(page: hug.types.number = 1, limit: hug.types.number = 10):
    '''
    Get a list of users

    Retrieves a paginated list of users.

    :param page: The page number to fetch (default: 1)
    :param limit: The number of users per page (default: 10)
    :return: A list of users
    '''
    users = get_users_from_database(page, limit)
    return {
        'users': users,
        'pagination': {
            'page': page,
            'limit': limit,
            'total': get_total_users_count()
        }
    }
```

### 4. Error Codes

Lastly, document any potential error codes and their meanings, providing developers with the necessary information to handle different scenarios.

For example:

```python
@hug.get('/users/{user_id}')
def get_user(user_id: hug.types.number):
    '''
    Get user by ID

    Retrieves user information based on the provided user ID.

    :param user_id: The ID of the user
    :return: User information including name, email, and address
    :raises hug.HTTPNotFound: If the user is not found
    '''
    user = get_user_from_database(user_id)
    
    if not user:
        raise hug.HTTPNotFound('User not found')
    
    return user
```

### Generating Documentation

Once you have documented your Hug APIs using Markdown, you can generate a documentation site by leveraging tools like Sphinx or static site generators.

By following these documentation practices, you can create comprehensive API documentation for your Hug-powered Python project, making it easier for developers to understand, use, and maintain your APIs. Happy documenting!
