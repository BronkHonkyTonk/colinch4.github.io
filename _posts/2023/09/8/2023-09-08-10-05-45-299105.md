Boto3 is the AWS SDK (Software Development Kit) for Python, which allows you to interact with various AWS services including Amazon Textract. **Amazon Textract** is a service that enables you to extract text and structured data from scanned documents or images.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use Boto3 to analyze documents using Amazon Textract.

## Requirements

To follow along with the examples in this blog post, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- Boto3 library installed (`pip install boto3`)
- AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions to access the Amazon Textract service

## Building a Document Analyzer

Let's start by creating a Python script that utilizes the Boto3 library to analyze a document using Amazon Textract.

```python
import boto3

def analyze_document(bucket_name, document_name):
    # Create a Textract client
    textract_client = boto3.client('textract')

    # Start the document analysis job
    response = textract_client.start_document_analysis(
        DocumentLocation={
            'S3Object': {
                'Bucket': bucket_name,
                'Name': document_name
            }
        },
        FeatureTypes=[
            'TABLES', 'FORMS'
        ]
    )

    # Get the job ID
    job_id = response['JobId']

    # Retrieve the job status
    job_status = get_job_status(textract_client, job_id)

    # Print the extracted text
    if job_status == 'SUCCEEDED':
        response = textract_client.get_document_analysis(JobId=job_id)
        blocks = response['Blocks']

        for block in blocks:
            if block['BlockType'] == 'LINE':
                print(block['Text'])

def get_job_status(client, job_id):
    response = client.get_document_analysis(JobId=job_id)
    status = response['JobStatus']
    return status


# Provide the bucket name and document name
bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'
document_name = 'your-document.pdf'

# Analyze the document
analyze_document(bucket_name, document_name)
```

In the above code, we first import the `boto3` library and define a function `analyze_document` that takes in the bucket name and document name as parameters.

Inside the `analyze_document` function, we create a Textract client using `boto3.client('textract')`. We then start the Textract document analysis job by calling the `start_document_analysis` method. We provide the S3 bucket name and document name, along with the desired feature types (in this case, TABLES and FORMS).

After starting the analysis job, we retrieve the job ID from the response and use the `get_job_status` helper function to check the status of the job. We continuously check the job status until it reaches the 'SUCCEEDED' state.

Once the job is successfully completed, we call the `get_document_analysis` method to retrieve the analyzed document's information. We iterate over the blocks returned and print the extracted text for each line block.

Lastly, we provide the bucket name and document name, and then call the `analyze_document` function to start the document analysis.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to use Boto3 to analyze documents using Amazon Textract. We covered the requirements, built a document analyzer script, and demonstrated how to extract text from an analyzed document.

Amazon Textract provides powerful capabilities for document analysis, enabling you to automate document processing tasks.

Remember to handle any potential errors and update the code as per your specific requirements. Enjoy exploring Amazon Textract and its possibilities with Boto3!
