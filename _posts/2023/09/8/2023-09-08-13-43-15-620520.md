## Introduction
Regular expressions are an essential tool for pattern matching and text manipulation. Python provides a built-in library called `re` for working with regular expressions. However, in some cases, the functionality provided by the `re` library might not be sufficient. In such scenarios, it might be necessary to analyze and extend the internal code of the `re` library itself. In this blog post, we will explore the process of **analyzing** the internal code of the `re` library and discuss how to **extend** its functionality.

## Analyzing the Internal Code
To understand the internal working of the `re` library, it is important to dive into the source code. The `re` library is implemented in pure Python, making it relatively easy to analyze.

```python
import re
import inspect

source_code = inspect.getsource(re)
print(source_code)
```

The above code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the source code of the `re` library using the `inspect` module. By printing the `source_code` variable, we can see the entire implementation of the library.

Analyzing the internal code of the `re` library can provide insights into the underlying algorithms and techniques used for pattern matching. This knowledge can be helpful when customizing or extending the functionality of the library.

## Extending the Functionality
Sometimes, the built-in functionality provided by the `re` library might not meet specific requirements. In such cases, extending the library becomes necessary. Here's an example of how to extend the `re` library to add a new feature.

```python
import re

def custom_search(pattern, text):
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    
    if match:
        # Custom functionality for matched pattern
        print("Pattern matched successfully!")
        print("Start index:", match.start())
        print("End index:", match.end())
        print("Matched text:", match.group())
    else:
        print("Pattern not found!")

# Usage
custom_search(r'\d+', 'Hello 123 World')
```

In the code above, we define a `custom_search` function that internally uses the `re.search` function from the `re` library. Additionally, we enhance the functionality by providing custom actions to perform when a pattern is matched or not matched.

## Conclusion
Analyzing and extending the internal code of the `re` library can help us gain a deeper understanding of its inner workings. This knowledge enables us to customize and extend its functionality to better suit our needs. Regular expressions are a powerful tool, and by exploring their internals, we can unlock their true potential.

Remember to handle the internal code with care and to thoroughly test any customizations or extensions before using them in production environments.
