In numerical analysis, adaptive integration methods play a crucial role in computing definite integrals accurately. The mpmath library in Python provides adaptive integration methods, including adaptive quadrature method and recursive integration method, which can handle a wide range of integrals with high precision.

## Adaptive Quadrature Method

The adaptive quadrature method, also known as adaptive Gaussian quadrature, is a numerical integration technique that divides the integration interval into smaller subintervals and applies a quadrature rule on each subinterval. The mpmath library provides the `quad` function for adaptive integration.

Here's an example of how to use the `quad` function to compute the definite integral of a function:

```python
from mpmath import quad

def f(x):
    return x**2

result, error = quad(f, [0, 1])
print(f"The integral result: {result}")
print(f"The estimated error: {error}")
```

In this example, the `quad` function is called with the function `f(x)` and the integration interval `[0, 1]`. The function `f(x)` defines the integrand, which is `x^2` in this case. The `quad` function returns the approximate result of the integral and an estimate of the error.

## Recursive Integration Method

The mpmath library also provides a recursive integration method, which is based on the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rule. This method recursively subdivides the integration interval and applies the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rule on each subinterval.

Here's an example of how to use the `quadosc` function for recursive integration:

```python
from mpmath import quadosc

def f(x):
    return x**2

result, error = quadosc(f, [0, 1])
print(f"The integral result: {result}")
print(f"The estimated error: {error}")
```

In this example, the `quadosc` function is called with the same function `f(x)` and integration interval `[0, 1]`. The `quadosc` function computes the definite integral using the recursive integration method and returns the result along with the estimated error.

## Conclusion

The mpmath library in Python provides powerful tools for adaptive integration, including adaptive quadrature and recursive integration methods. These methods enable accurate and efficient computation of definite integrals with high precision. By utilizing these techniques, you can handle a wide range of integration problems in your Python projects.

Remember to import the necessary functions from the mpmath library and define your integrand function accordingly. Experiment with different integration intervals and functions to explore the capabilities of the mpmath library for adaptive integration.
