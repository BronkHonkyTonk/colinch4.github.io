Sympy is a powerful Python library for symbolic mathematics. It provides functions to solve various mathematical equations, including **inequalities**. In this blog post, we will explore how to use Sympy to solve inequalities in Python.

## Installing Sympy

Before we start, make sure you have Sympy installed on your system. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install sympy
```

## Solving Inequalities with Sympy

Sympy provides several functions to solve different types of inequalities. Here are some commonly used functions:

1. `solveset`: This function solves a given inequality symbolically and returns a set of solutions.

2. `simplify`: This function simplfies the solution set obtained from `solveset`.

3. `Interval`: This class represents a closed interval.

Now, let's dive into some examples to understand how to use these functions.

### Example 1: Solving Linear Inequalities

Let's start with solving a simple linear inequality:

```python
from sympy import symbols, solveset, S

x = symbols('x')
ineq = x < 5
solution = solveset(ineq, domain=S.Reals)
print(solution)
```

In this example, we define a symbolic variable `x` and an inequality `x < 5`. We use the `solveset` function to find the solution set of the inequality. The `domain=S.Reals` argument specifies that we want the solution in the set of real numbers. Finally, we print the solution set. The output will be:

```
Interval(-oo, 5)
```

This means the solution set is the interval from negative infinity to 5, excluding 5.

### Example 2: Simplifying Inequalities

Sometimes, the solution returned by `solveset` can be complex. We can simplify the solution set using the `simplify` function. Let's look at an example:

```python
from sympy import symbols, solveset, simplify

x = symbols('x')
ineq = x**2 - 2*x - 3 >= 0
solution = solveset(ineq, domain=S.Reals)
simplified_solution = simplify(solution)
print(simplified_solution)
```

In this example, we define `x` as a symbol and an inequality `x**2 - 2*x - 3 >= 0`. We solve the inequality using `solveset` and then simplify the solution set using `simplify`. The output will be:

```
(-∞, 1 + √7] ∪ [1 - √7, ∞)
```

### Example 3: Solving System of Inequalities

Sympy can also handle systems of inequalities. Let's see an example:

```python
from sympy import symbols, And, solveset

x, y = symbols('x y')
ineq1 = x > 2
ineq2 = y <= 5
system = And(ineq1, ineq2)
solution = solveset(system, domain=S.Reals)
print(solution)
```

In this example, we define two inequalities `x > 2` and `y <= 5`. We combine them into a system using the `And` function. We then solve the system using `solveset` and print the solution set. The output will be:

```
(2, 5]
```

This means the solution set is the interval from 2 to 5, including both endpoints.

## Conclusion

Sympy provides a convenient way to solve inequalities symbolically in Python. It allows us to solve linear inequalities, simplify solutions, and even handle systems of inequalities. By using Sympy, we can easily work with mathematical inequalities in our Python programs.
