Logging is a powerful tool in Python that allows us to record and display information about the execution of our code. It helps in debugging, monitoring, and analyzing the behavior of a program. In this blog post, we will explore how to output log messages based on different log levels using the `logging` module in Python.

## Logging Levels

Logging levels provide a way to categorize and prioritize log messages. Python provides several built-in logging levels that are commonly used. Here are the most commonly used logging levels:

- DEBUG: Detailed information, typically useful for debugging purposes.
- INFO: Confirmation that everything is working as expected.
- WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened or an attention reminder.
- ERROR: A more serious problem that prevents the code from working correctly.
- CRITICAL: A very serious error that may lead to application termination.

## Basic Logging Configuration

To start logging messages, we need to import the `logging` module in our Python script. Here's an example of the basic setup:

```python
import logging

# Set the logging configuration
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Log messages
logging.debug("This is a debug message")
logging.info("This is an info message")
logging.warning("This is a warning message")
logging.error("This is an error message")
logging.critical("This is a critical message")
```

In the above code, we first import the `logging` module. Then, we set the logging configuration using the `basicConfig` function. We specify the logging level as `logging.DEBUG`, which means all messages with a level of DEBUG and above will be displayed. The format specifies how the log messages will be displayed, with `%levelname` representing the log level and `%message` representing the actual log message.

Following the configuration, we log messages of different levels using the `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, and `critical` functions available in the `logging` module.

## Customizing Logging Configuration

Apart from the basic configuration, we can customize the logging behavior further. We can specify the log level, log format, log output location, and many other settings.

Here's an example of a customized logging configuration:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,
                    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
                    filename='app.log',
                    filemode='w')

logger = logging.getLogger()

# Log messages to different log levels
logger.debug("This is a debug message")

# Change the log level dynamically
logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)
logger.warning("This is a warning message")

# Log messages to the console
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
console_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
console_formatter = logging.Formatter('%(levelname)s - %(message)s')
console_handler.setFormatter(console_formatter)
logger.addHandler(console_handler)
logger.info("This is an info message")
```

In this example, we set the log level as `logging.DEBUG`, the log format as `%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s`, and direct the log messages to a file named `app.log` using the `filename` parameter.

We can obtain a `logger` instance by calling `logging.getLogger()`. This logger allows us to log messages to different log levels dynamically. In this case, we change the log level to `logging.WARNING` and log a warning message.

We can also add a `StreamHandler` to log messages to the console. We set the log level of the console handler as `logging.INFO` and specify a custom log format using the `console_formatter`. Finally, we add the console handler to the logger and log an info message.

## Conclusion

The `logging` module in Python provides a flexible and powerful mechanism for logging messages based on different log levels. It allows us to record and analyze the behavior of our code effectively.

In this blog post, we explored how to configure logging levels and output log messages using the `logging` module in Python. We saw examples of basic and customized logging configurations, which can be adjusted to meet specific requirements.

By utilizing the logging capabilities in Python, we can easily monitor the execution of our code and identify any issues or unexpected behavior efficiently.
