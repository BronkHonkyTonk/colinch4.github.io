FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and provides high performance.

In this blog post, we will explore how to build a 비동기 (asynchronous) RESTful API using FastAPI in Python.

## Installation

To get started with FastAPI, we need to install it. Run the following command to install FastAPI and its dependencies:

```python
pip install fastapi
```

We will also need an asynchronous web server to run our FastAPI application. We can use `uvicorn`, one of the recommended servers for FastAPI. Install it with the following command:

```python
pip install uvicorn
```

## Creating a FastAPI Application

Let's start by creating a new Python file, `main.py`, for our FastAPI application. First, we need to import the necessary modules:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
```

Then, create an instance of the `FastAPI` class:

```python
app = FastAPI()
```

## Defining Routes and Handlers

FastAPI allows us to define routes using Python's type hints. For example, let's define a simple `GET` route at `/` that returns a welcome message:

```python
@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to the FastAPI RESTful API!"}
```

In the above example, we use the `@app.get` decorator to specify that this route corresponds to `GET` requests. The `async def` keyword indicates that this is an asynchronous function. Inside the function, we simply return a dictionary, which FastAPI automatically converts to JSON.

## Running the Application

To run the FastAPI application, use the `uvicorn` command with the filename and the `app` variable. In our case, the command will be:

```python
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The `--reload` option automatically reloads the server every time we make changes to the code. This makes development and testing easier.

## Testing the API

With the FastAPI application running, we can now test our API. Open your web browser or an API testing tool like Postman and access `http://localhost:8000/`. You should see the welcome message:

```json
{
    "message": "Welcome to the FastAPI RESTful API!"
}
```

Congratulations! We have successfully built a 비동기 RESTful API using FastAPI in Python.

## Conclusion

FastAPI is a powerful and efficient web framework for building RESTful APIs in Python. It allows us to write asynchronous code, which improves performance and scalability. Its intuitive syntax and automatic documentation generation make it an excellent choice for building modern web APIs.

In this blog post, we covered the basics of building a FastAPI application, defining routes, handling requests, and running the application. I hope this article has given you a good starting point for building your own 비동기 RESTful APIs with FastAPI. Keep exploring and building amazing things with FastAPI!
