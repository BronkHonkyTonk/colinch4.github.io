In Python, the `datetime` module provides various functions and classes to manipulate dates and times. If you need to find out the week number of a specific date, you can use the `isocalendar()` method available in the `datetime` object.

Let's see an example:

```python
import datetime

# Specify the date for which we want to obtain the week number
year = 2022
month = 10
day = 25

# Create a datetime object with the specified date
date = datetime.date(year, month, day)

# Obtain the week number and year of the specified date
week_number = date.isocalendar()[1]
year = date.isocalendar()[0]

print(f"Week number of {date}: {week_number}")
print(f"Year of {date}: {year}")
```

In the above example, we import the `datetime` module and specify the date as year, month, and day variables. Then, we create a `date` object using the specified date. 

We can obtain the week number and year of the specified date by calling the `isocalendar()` method on the `date` object. The `isocalendar()` method returns a tuple containing the year, week number, and weekday. We can access the week number using index 1 and the year using index 0 from the returned tuple.

Finally, we print the week number and year of the specified date using f-strings.

When you run the above code, you will get the following output:

```
Week number of 2022-10-25: 43
Year of 2022-10-25: 2022
```

This means that October 25, 2022, falls in the 43rd week of the year 2022.

By using the `isocalendar()` method, you can easily obtain the week number of any specific date in Python.
