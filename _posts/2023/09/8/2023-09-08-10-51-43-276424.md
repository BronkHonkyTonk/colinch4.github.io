pyOpenSSL is a Python library that provides a high-level interface to the OpenSSL library, allowing developers to utilize SSL/TLS functionality in their applications. SSL/TLS versions play a crucial role in securing network communications, and it is important to ensure that the correct version is utilized according to your application's requirements and the security standards you wish to adhere to.

In this blog post, we will explore how to manage SSL/TLS versions using pyOpenSSL in Python.

## Checking the Default SSL/TLS Version

By default, pyOpenSSL uses the system's default SSL/TLS version. To check the default version, you can use the `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION` constant:

```python
import ssl

print(ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION)
```

The output will show the version of OpenSSL being used by pyOpenSSL.

## Setting a Specific SSL/TLS Version

To set a specific SSL/TLS version in pyOpenSSL, you can use the `ssl.SSLContext` class. This class provides methods for configuring SSL/TLS options, including the version.

```python
import ssl

# Create an SSL context
ctx = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)

# Use the SSL context in your code
# ...
```

In this example, we create an SSL context using the `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2` constant, which specifies the TLS version 1.2. You can replace `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2` with other supported protocol constants like `ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23`, `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS`, etc., depending on your requirements.

## Checking Supported SSL/TLS Versions

pyOpenSSL supports various SSL/TLS versions, and it is essential to know what versions are supported by your version of pyOpenSSL. To check the supported versions, you can use the `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_INFO` constant:

```python
import ssl

print(ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_INFO)
```

The output will provide detailed information about the OpenSSL library and the supported SSL/TLS versions.

## Handling SSL/TLS Protocol Negotiation

Sometimes, you may want to support multiple SSL/TLS versions and let the client and server negotiate the highest mutually supported version. To achieve this, you can specify multiple versions in the `ssl.SSLContext` object:

```python
import ssl

# Create an SSL context with multiple versions
ctx = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS)

# Specify multiple versions supported by the server
ctx.options |= ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1
ctx.options |= ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1_1

# Use the SSL context in your code
# ...
```

In this example, we create an SSL context with the `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS` constant, which indicates that the server can support multiple versions. We then disable the TLS v1 and TLS v1.1 protocols using the `ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1` and `ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1_1` options, respectively.

## Conclusion

pyOpenSSL provides a convenient way to manage SSL/TLS versions in Python applications. By specifying the desired version using the `ssl.SSLContext` class, you can enhance the security and compatibility of your network communications. Whether you need to set a specific version or negotiate the highest supported version, pyOpenSSL has you covered.

Remember to stay up-to-date with the latest security standards and consult the OpenSSL documentation for more information on SSL/TLS versions and best practices.
