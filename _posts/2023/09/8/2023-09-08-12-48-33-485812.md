In mathematical calculus, one of the fundamental operations is differentiation. When working with symbolic expressions and equations, it is often necessary to calculate derivatives to find critical points, slopes, or rates of change. In Python, the `sympy` library provides a powerful tool for symbolic computing, including differentiation.

## Installing sympy

Before we begin, make sure to have `sympy` installed on your machine. You can install it using `pip` by running the following command:

```
pip install sympy
```

## Basic Usage

Let's start with a simple example. Suppose we want to find the derivative of the function `f(x) = x^2` at a specific point. Here's how we can use `sympy` to calculate the derivative:

```python
from sympy import symbols, diff

# Define the symbol
x = symbols('x')

# Define the function
f = x**2

# Calculate the derivative
f_prime = diff(f, x)

print(f_prime)
```

Running this code will output `2*x`, indicating that the derivative of `x^2` with respect to `x` is `2*x`. We can also evaluate the derivative at a specific point using the `subs` method:

```python
f_prime_value = f_prime.subs(x, 3)

print(f_prime_value)
```

This will output `6`, which is the value of the derivative at `x = 3`.

## Higher Order Derivatives

`sympy` can also calculate higher order derivatives. For example, let's find the second derivative of the function `f(x) = x^3`:

```python
from sympy import symbols, diff

# Define the symbol
x = symbols('x')

# Define the function
f = x**3

# Calculate the second derivative
f_double_prime = diff(f, x, 2)

print(f_double_prime)
```

Running this code will output `6*x`, indicating that the second derivative of `x^3` with respect to `x` is `6*x`.

## Partial Derivatives

In addition to ordinary derivatives, `sympy` can also calculate partial derivatives. This is useful when working with multivariable functions. Suppose we have a function `f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2` and we want to find the partial derivatives with respect to `x` and `y`. Here's how we can do it:

```python
from sympy import symbols, diff

# Define the symbols
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Define the function
f = x**2 + y**2

# Calculate the partial derivatives
f_x = diff(f, x)
f_y = diff(f, y)

print(f_x)
print(f_y)
```

Running this code will output `2*x` for `f_x` and `2*y` for `f_y`, indicating the partial derivatives with respect to `x` and `y`, respectively.

## Conclusion

The `sympy` library in Python provides a convenient way to perform symbolic differentiation using the `diff` function. With `sympy`, you can easily calculate derivatives, including higher order and partial derivatives, for various mathematical expressions and functions.
