Python is a versatile programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented programming and functional programming. While object-oriented programming (OOP) is widely used and well-known, functional programming (FP) is gaining popularity due to its expressive and concise nature. In this blog post, we will explore `functools` module in Python and see how it can be used to embrace functional programming principles.

## What is functools?

`functools` is a built-in Python module that provides higher-order functions and function decorators that operate on other functions. It aims to enhance the capabilities of Python's functions, making them more functional and enabling easy composition of functions.

## Decorators

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to modify the behavior of a function without changing its source code. `functools` provides the `wraps` decorator, which is commonly used to preserve the metadata of the original function when creating a decorated function.

```python
import functools

def my_decorator(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Do something before calling the function
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # Do something after calling the function
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def my_function():
    pass

print(my_function.__name__)  # Output: my_function
```

In the above example, the `wraps` decorator ensures that the decorated function `my_function` retains its original name and docstring.

## Higher-order functions

Functional programming emphasizes the use of higher-order functions, which are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. `functools` provides several higher-order functions that are commonly used in functional programming.

### functools.partial

`functools.partial` is a powerful function that allows you to "freeze" some portion of a function's arguments and generate a new function with the remaining arguments. This is useful when you have a function that takes multiple arguments, but you want to create a new function with some arguments pre-filled.

```python
import functools

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

double = functools.partial(multiply, b=2)
triple = functools.partial(multiply, b=3)

print(double(5))  # Output: 10
print(triple(5))  # Output: 15
```

In the above example, `functools.partial` is used to create new functions `double` and `triple` based on the `multiply` function. The `b` argument is pre-filled with the respective values 2 and 3.

### functools.compose

`functools.compose` allows you to compose multiple functions into a single function. It takes two or more functions as arguments and returns a new function that is the composition of those functions.

```python
import functools

def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

def multiply_by_two(x):
    return x * 2

transform = functools.compose(add_one, multiply_by_two)

print(transform(5))  # Output: 11
```

In the above example, `functools.compose` is used to create a new function `transform` which is the composition of `add_one` and `multiply_by_two`. The input is first multiplied by two and then one is added to the result.

## Conclusion

The `functools` module in Python provides powerful tools for embracing functional programming principles. By using decorators and higher-order functions, you can write more expressive and concise code. Whether you are new to functional programming or want to enhance your existing codebase, `functools` is a valuable tool to have in your Python toolbox.
