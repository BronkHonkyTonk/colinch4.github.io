Apache Airflow is a widely used open-source platform for orchestrating and scheduling complex workflows. It allows you to define, schedule, and monitor data pipelines as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

In this blog post, we will explore how to configure the timezone and schedule settings in Airflow using Python.

## Timezone 설정

By default, Airflow uses the UTC timezone for all its operations. However, you can customize this setting to match your preferred timezone. Here's how you can set the timezone in your Airflow configuration file:

```python
# airflow.cfg

[core]
...
default_timezone = <YOUR_TIMEZONE>
...
```

Replace `<YOUR_TIMEZONE>` with the desired timezone name, such as 'America/New_York' or 'Asia/Tokyo'.

Additionally, you can set the timezone programmatically within your DAGs using the `default_args` parameter. Here's an example:

```python
from datetime import datetime

from airflow import DAG

default_args = {
    'start_date': datetime(2022, 1, 1),
    'retries': 3,
    'provide_context': True,
    'execution_timezone': <YOUR_TIMEZONE>
}

with DAG('my_dag', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval='@daily') as dag:
    # DAG definition goes here
    ...
```

Make sure to replace `<YOUR_TIMEZONE>` with the desired timezone name.

## Schedule 설정

Airflow allows you to define the schedule for your DAGs using cron expressions or interval notation. Here are some examples of different schedule settings:

- Run the DAG every day at 8 AM:

  ```python
  schedule_interval='0 8 * * *'
  ```

- Run the DAG every hour:

  ```python
  schedule_interval='@hourly'
  ```

- Run the DAG every 15 minutes:

  ```python
  schedule_interval='*/15 * * * *'
  ```

You can specify the schedule_interval parameter when defining your DAG. Make sure to choose a schedule that suits the requirements of your workflow.

## Conclusion

Configuring the timezone and schedule settings in Airflow is crucial to ensure that your workflows run at the desired times and in the correct timezone. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily customize the timezone and schedule settings in your Airflow environment.

Remember to choose the appropriate timezone and schedule that align with your workflow requirements. Happy scheduling!
