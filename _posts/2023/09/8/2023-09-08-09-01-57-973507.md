FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It allows you to define API endpoints using Python functions and supports automatic validation, serialization, and documentation.

One of the essential features of FastAPI is the support for **path parameters**, also known as **route parameters** or **URL parameters**. These parameters allow you to define dynamic parts in your API routes and retrieve them within your route functions.

## Defining Path Parameters

To define a path parameter in FastAPI, you need to include it as part of the route path. Path parameters are denoted by wrapping them in curly braces `{}`. Here's an example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```

In this example, we define a route `GET /items/{item_id}` that expects an integer `item_id` as a path parameter. FastAPI will automatically validate and convert the path parameter to the specified Python type (`int` in this case) before calling the route function `read_item`.

## Accessing Path Parameters

To access the value of a path parameter, you simply include it as an argument in your route function definition. FastAPI will automatically recognize the parameter and pass the corresponding value at runtime. Here's an example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```

In this example, the `item_id` path parameter is accessed as a function argument. You can use it within the function to perform your desired operations, such as retrieving data from a database or calling another API.

## Optional Path Parameters

Path parameters can also be optional by specifying a default value. This can be useful when you have routes that accept optional filters, query parameters, or other optional parts in the URL. Here's an example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

In this example, we introduce an optional query parameter `q` by adding `= None` after its type. If the query parameter is included in the URL, its value will be passed to the `read_item` function. If it's not included, the default value `None` will be used.

## Documentation and Validation

FastAPI automatically generates interactive documentation (e.g., Swagger UI and ReDoc) based on the defined routes and their parameters. It also provides built-in validation for path parameters, ensuring that the data types and constraints are respected.

By leveraging FastAPI's path parameters feature, you can easily build flexible and powerful APIs that handle dynamic URLs and retrieve relevant information from the requested paths.
