To use `csv.DictReader`, we first need to import the `csv` module. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import csv

# Open the CSV file
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:

    # Create a DictReader object
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)

    # Iterate over each row in the CSV file
    for row in reader:
        # Access the values using the keys
        name = row['Name']
        age = row['Age']
        email = row['Email']

        # Do something with the data
        print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Email: {email}")
```

In this example, we assume that the CSV file has three columns: 'Name', 'Age', and 'Email'. You can replace these column names with the headers of your CSV file.

The `DictReader` object allows us to iterate over each row in the CSV file. We can then access the values using the respective column headers as keys. In the code snippet, we store the values in variables (`name`, `age`, `email`) and print them. You can perform any operations or computations on the data as per your requirements.

Remember to replace `'data.csv'` with the actual path or filename of your CSV file. Ensure that the CSV file is in the same directory as your Python script or provide the correct file path.

Using `csv.DictReader` simplifies the process of reading and accessing CSV data in Python, providing a more structured and convenient way to work with tabular data.
