Logging is an essential tool for developers to debug and monitor their applications. It allows us to record important events or messages during the execution of our code. In Python, the logging module provides a flexible and powerful logging system. One of the key features of the logging module is the ability to set different logging levels for different parts of your code. In this blog post, we'll explore how to configure logging levels in Python.

## Logging Levels

The logging module in Python defines several levels of log messages, each with its own importance and severity. Here are the common logging levels in order of increasing severity:

- DEBUG: Detailed information used for diagnostic purposes.
- INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.
- WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened or potential issues.
- ERROR: Indicates a more serious problem that prevents the application from functioning properly.
- CRITICAL: Indicates a critical error that may lead to the application's termination.

## Setting the Logging Level

By default, the logging level is set to WARNING, which means that only log messages with a level of WARNING and above will be captured. However, you can adjust the logging level to suit your needs by using the `basicConfig()` or `Logger.setLevel()` method.

### Using `basicConfig()`

The `basicConfig()` function is a convenient way to configure the logging level for the root logger. Here's an example of how to set the logging level to DEBUG:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Using `Logger.setLevel()`

If you want to set the logging level for a specific logger, you can use the `setLevel()` method of the `Logger` class. Here's an example of how to set the logging level for a logger named "my_logger" to INFO:

```python
import logging

my_logger = logging.getLogger("my_logger")
my_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
```

## Logging Messages

Once the logging level is set, you can start logging messages in your code. The logging module provides various functions (e.g., `debug()`, `info()`, `warning()`, `error()`, `critical()`) to log messages with different severity levels.

Here's an example of how to log messages at different levels:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

logging.debug("This is a debug message")
logging.info("This is an info message")
logging.warning("This is a warning message")
logging.error("This is an error message")
logging.critical("This is a critical message")
```

In the example above, since the logging level is set to DEBUG, all the log messages will be captured and displayed on the console. However, if you change the logging level to INFO, only INFO level and above messages will be displayed.

## Conclusion

Setting the appropriate logging level is crucial for effective debugging and monitoring of your Python applications. By leveraging the logging module's logging levels, you can control the amount of information captured, making it easier to pinpoint issues in your code. Whether you're developing a small script or a large-scale application, logging can greatly simplify the process of identifying and fixing bugs.

Remember to **choose the appropriate logging level** to strike a balance between capturing enough information for debugging and avoiding excessive log noise in your application.
