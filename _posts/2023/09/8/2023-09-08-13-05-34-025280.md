Sympy is a powerful library for symbolic mathematics in Python. It allows us to perform various mathematical operations symbolically, manipulate algebraic expressions, solve equations, and much more. However, sometimes we may need to convert these symbolic expressions into numerical functions for further numerical computations or to use them in other programming languages.

In Sympy, we have two main methods for code generation: `lambdify` and `codegen`. These methods allow us to convert symbolic expressions into callable functions or even generate standalone code files in different languages such as Python, C, Fortran, and more.

### `lambdify` method

The `lambdify` function provided by Sympy is a convenient and straightforward way to convert symbolic expressions to callable functions. It takes a symbolic expression and generates a NumPy-aware function that we can directly use and evaluate.

Here is an example of how to use `lambdify`:

```python
import sympy as sp
import numpy as np

# Define a symbolic expression
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
expr = sp.sin(x) + sp.cos(y)

# Create a lambda function
f = sp.lambdify((x, y), expr)

# Evaluate the function at a specific point
result = f(np.pi/4, np.pi/3)
print(result)
```

In the above code, we define a symbolic expression involving `x` and `y`. We then use `sp.lambdify` to create a function `f`, which takes `x` and `y` as arguments and returns the evaluated expression value. Finally, we evaluate the function at a specific point `(np.pi/4, np.pi/3)` and print the result.

### `codegen` method

The `codegen` method in Sympy goes one step further and can automatically generate code files in different programming languages. This is particularly useful when we want to use the symbolic expressions in environments that do not support Sympy directly.

Here is an example of how to use `codegen`:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define a symbolic expression
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
expr = sp.sin(x) + sp.cos(y)

# Generate Python code
python_code = sp.printing.pycode(expr)
print(python_code)

# Generate C code
c_code = sp.printing.ccode(expr)
print(c_code)

# Generate Fortran code
fortran_code = sp.printing.fcode(expr)
print(fortran_code)
```

In the above code, we define a symbolic expression involving `x` and `y`. We then use different Sympy print functions (`pycode`, `ccode`, `fcode`) to generate code snippets in Python, C, and Fortran, respectively.

By using `codegen`, we can integrate the generated code into other programming environments and leverage the symbolic computations done with Sympy.

Sympy provides flexible and powerful tools for code generation. Whether you need to create callable functions or generate code in different programming languages, Sympy's `lambdify` and `codegen` methods have got you covered.
