When it comes to logging in Python, the built-in `logging` module provides an extensive set of functionality to handle logging of messages and events in an application. In addition to the standard file handlers, the module also offers a `WatchedFileHandler` class, which is particularly useful for scenarios where the log file needs to be rotated or changed during the application's runtime.

The `WatchedFileHandler` class is a drop-in replacement for the `FileHandler` class in the `logging` module. It allows you to specify a log file that will be monitored for changes, and automatically switches to a new log file when the current file is rotated or modified. This is particularly helpful in situations where log files need to be regularly rotated to manage their size or for archiving purposes.

To use the `WatchedFileHandler` class in your Python application, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:
```python
import logging
from logging.handlers import WatchedFileHandler
```

2. Set up the main logger and configure its behavior:
```python
logger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

3. Create an instance of the `WatchedFileHandler` class and set its properties:
```python
handler = WatchedFileHandler('my_logs.log')  # Specify the log file path
handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # Set the desired log level
```

4. Add the handler to the logger:
```python
logger.addHandler(handler)
```

Now, whenever the log file specified (`my_logs.log` in this example) is rotated or modified, the `WatchedFileHandler` will automatically switch to the new log file and continue writing log messages to it. This ensures that your application can keep logging without interruption, even when the log file is actively being changed.

Additionally, you can also configure other properties of the `WatchedFileHandler` instance, such as setting the log file encoding, formatting the log messages, or defining the maximum size of the log files before rotation.

```python
handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'))

# Configure maximum log file size before rotation (e.g., 10 MB)
handler.maxBytes = 10000000

# Configure the number of log files to keep (e.g., 3 files)
handler.backupCount = 3
```

By utilizing the `WatchedFileHandler` class in the `logging` module, you can easily manage log files that need to be rotated or modified during the runtime of your Python applications. This ensures continuous logging without the need for manual intervention, ultimately improving the manageability of your application's logs.
