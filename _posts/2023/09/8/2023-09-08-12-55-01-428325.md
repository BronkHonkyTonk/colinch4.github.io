In scientific and engineering domains, it is common to encounter systems of differential equations that need to be solved numerically. `mpmath` is a powerful Python library that provides high-precision numerical computing capabilities, including the ability to solve systems of differential equations.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use `mpmath` to solve systems of differential equations in Python.

## Installing mpmath

First, let's make sure that `mpmath` is installed on your system. You can install it using `pip` by running the following command:

```
pip install mpmath
```

Once it is installed, you can import it in your Python code as follows:

```python
import mpmath
```

## Defining the System of Differential Equations

To solve a system of differential equations with `mpmath`, we need to define the equations as functions. Each function represents an equation in the system, and takes as input the dependent variables and their derivatives.

Let's take a simple example of a system of two first-order differential equations:

```
dy/dt = -2 * y
dz/dt = 4 * y - z
```

We can define these equations in Python as follows:

```python
def equation1(y, z):
    return -2 * y

def equation2(y, z):
    return 4 * y - z
```

## Solving the System of Differential Equations

Once we have defined the equations, we can utilize `mpmath` to solve the system of differential equations numerically.

Here are the steps to solve the system using `mpmath`:

1. Create a `mpmath` context to specify the precision and working precision.
2. Define the variables and their initial conditions.
3. Use the `odefun` function to define the system of differential equations.
4. Solve the equations using the `odeint` function, specifying the start and end time, initial conditions, and the step size.

Here is an example implementation:

```python
import mpmath

def equation1(y, z):
    return -2 * y

def equation2(y, z):
    return 4 * y - z

def solve_system():
    t = mpmath.linspace(0, 1, 100)  # Time range
    y0 = 1  # Initial condition for y
    z0 = 2  # Initial condition for z

    # Create a mpmath context
    mpmath.mp.dps = 25

    # Define the system of differential equations
    def odefun(Y, t):
        y, z = Y
        return [equation1(y, z), equation2(y, z)]

    # Solve the system of differential equations
    sol = mpmath.solve_ivp(odefun, [0, 1], [y0, z0], t)

    return sol

solution = solve_system()
print(solution.y)
```

In this example, we have used the `solve_ivp` function from `mpmath` to solve the system of differential equations. The function returns an object containing the solution, which includes the values of `y` and `z` at different time intervals.

## Conclusion

Solving systems of differential equations is a crucial task in many scientific and engineering applications. `mpmath` provides a powerful and high-precision numerical computing environment in Python, allowing us to solve complex systems of differential equations.

In this blog post, we have explored how to use `mpmath` to solve a simple system of differential equations. You can extend this knowledge to solve more complex systems with additional equations and variables.

By leveraging the capabilities of `mpmath`, you can accurately model and solve systems of differential equations in your Python code.
