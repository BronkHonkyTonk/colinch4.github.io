The `functools` module in Python provides several useful functions for working with higher-order functions. One of the powerful features of `functools` is the ability to manipulate function signatures. This allows us to modify and enhance the behavior of functions without actually changing their code.

In this blog post, we will explore the various functions available in the `functools` module that allow us to manipulate function signatures in Python.

## Partial Functions with `functools.partial`

The `functools.partial` function allows us to create a new function with some arguments pre-filled from an existing function. This is particularly useful when we have a function that requires multiple arguments, but we want to create a simpler version of it with fewer arguments.

```python
from functools import partial

def add(a, b, c):
    return a + b + c

# Creating a partial function with the first argument pre-filled
add_5 = partial(add, 5)

# Calling the partial function
result = add_5(3, 2)
print(result) # Output: 10
```

In the example above, we create a partial function `add_5` by passing `add` and `5` as arguments to `functools.partial`. The resulting function can then be called with the remaining arguments (`3` and `2`), resulting in the sum `10`.

## Modifying Metadata with `functools.wraps`

The `functools.wraps` function is a decorator that allows us to update the metadata of a function, such as its name, docstring, and annotations. When we create a new function by modifying an existing one, the metadata of the original function is lost. Using `functools.wraps`, we can preserve this metadata for the new function.

```python
from functools import wraps

def logger(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling function: {func.__name__}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} called successfully")
        return result
    return wrapper

@logger
def multiply(a, b):
    """Multiply two numbers"""
    return a * b

result = multiply(3, 4)
print(result) # Output: 12
print(multiply.__name__) # Output: multiply
print(multiply.__doc__) # Output: Multiply two numbers
```

In the example above, the `logger` decorator wraps the `multiply` function using `wraps` from `functools`. This preserves the metadata of the original function, such as its name and docstring.

## Caching Function Results with `functools.lru_cache`

The `functools.lru_cache` function is a decorator that allows us to cache the results of a function and reuse them when the same arguments are provided. This can greatly improve the performance of functions that are computationally expensive or have expensive external dependencies.

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=3)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

fibonacci(5) # Calculates Fibonacci(0), Fibonacci(1), Fibonacci(2), Fibonacci(3), Fibonacci(4), and Fibonacci(5)
fibonacci(4) # Reuses the previously calculated Fibonacci(4) and Fibonacci(5)
```

In the example above, we define a `fibonacci` function that recursively calculates the Fibonacci sequence. By applying the `@lru_cache` decorator, the function's results are cached, allowing us to avoid redundant calculations for the same arguments.

## Conclusion

The `functools` module in Python provides powerful tools for manipulating function signatures. Whether it's creating partial functions, preserving metadata, or caching results, `functools` offers efficient solutions to enhance the behavior and performance of our functions. By leveraging these functions, we can write more concise and efficient code in Python.
