## Introduction

When working with regular expressions (regex) in Python, it can be quite useful to extract variable names and function names from the code. This information can be used for various purposes, such as documentation generation or code analysis.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use regex in Python to extract variable and function names from code snippets. We will provide examples and step-by-step explanations to help you understand the process.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with the examples in this blog post, you will need:

- Python installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of regex syntax
- Text editor or IDE to write and run Python code

## Variable Name Extraction

To extract variables names from code using regex, we need to consider the naming conventions and syntax rules of the programming language. Let's look at an example in Python:

```python
# Example Python code
name = "John Doe"
age = 25
is_student = True

def greet():
    print("Hello, " + name)
```

To extract the variable names (`name`, `age`, `is_student`) from the above code, we can use the following regex pattern:

```python
import re

code = """
# Example Python code
name = "John Doe"
age = 25
is_student = True

def greet():
    print("Hello, " + name)
"""

variable_pattern = r"(?<=\n|^)([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)\s*="
variables = re.findall(variable_pattern, code)
print(variables)
```

In the above code, we use the `re.findall()` function from the `re` module to find all matches of the regex pattern. The pattern `(?<=\n|^)([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)\s*=` matches variable names that are followed by an equal sign (`=`) and preceded by a new line character (`\n`) or the start of the code (`^`).

By running this code, you should see the following output:

```
['name', 'age', 'is_student']
```

## Function Name Extraction

Similarly, we can extract function names from code using regex. Let's consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
# Example Python code
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

def multiply_numbers(x, y):
    return x * y
```

To extract the function names (`add_numbers`, `multiply_numbers`) from the above code, we can use the following regex pattern:

```python
import re

code = """
# Example Python code
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

def multiply_numbers(x, y):
    return x * y
"""

function_pattern = r"def\s+([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)\("
functions = re.findall(function_pattern, code)
print(functions)
```

In the above code, the pattern `def\s+([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)\(` matches function names that are preceded by the keyword `def`, followed by one or more whitespace characters (`\s+`), and have opening parentheses (`\(`) immediately after the name.

By running this code, you should see the following output:

```
['add_numbers', 'multiply_numbers']
```

## Conclusion

Regex can be a powerful tool for extracting variable names and function names from code snippets. In this blog post, we explored how to use regex in Python to accomplish this task. We learned about the regex patterns and functions required to extract the desired information.

Next time you need to extract variable or function names from code, remember that regex can often provide an efficient and effective solution. Happy coding!
