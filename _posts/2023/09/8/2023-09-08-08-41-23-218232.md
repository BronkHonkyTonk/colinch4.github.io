Python's datetime module provides a powerful way to work with dates and times. With datetime, you can easily create, manipulate, and compare dates and times. In this blog post, we will explore how to use datetime in Python to create an event planner.

## Creating Events

To create an event planner, we need to define events with their respective start and end times. We can use the `datetime.datetime` class to represent these times. Here's an example of how to create an event:

```python
import datetime

event_start = datetime.datetime(2022, 4, 1, 14, 0)  # April 1st, 2022 2:00 PM
event_end = datetime.datetime(2022, 4, 1, 16, 0)  # April 1st, 2022 4:00 PM

event = {
    'title': 'Python Workshop',
    'start_time': event_start,
    'end_time': event_end
}
```

In this example, we defined an event called "Python Workshop" that starts on April 1st, 2022, at 2:00 PM and ends at 4:00 PM.


## Displaying Event Information

To display event information, we can use the `strftime` method of the `datetime` objects to format the date and time. Here's an example of how to display the event information:

```python
event_title = event['title']
start_time = event['start_time'].strftime("%A, %b %d, %Y %I:%M %p")
end_time = event['end_time'].strftime("%I:%M %p")

print(f"Event: {event_title}")
print(f"Start Time: {start_time}")
print(f"End Time: {end_time}")
```

The output will be:

```
Event: Python Workshop
Start Time: Friday, Apr 01, 2022 02:00 PM
End Time: 04:00 PM
```


## Checking for Overlapping Events

One important feature of an event planner is to check if there are any overlapping events. We can compare the start and end times of two events to determine if they overlap. Here's an example function that checks for overlapping events:

```python
def check_event_overlap(event1, event2):
    if event1['start_time'] <= event2['end_time'] and event1['end_time'] >= event2['start_time']:
        return True
    return False
```

You can use this function to find overlapping events in your event planner and take appropriate actions.

## Conclusion

Python's datetime module provides a convenient way to work with dates and times, making it ideal for creating an event planner. With datetime, you can easily create events, display their information, and check for overlapping events. This allows you to effectively plan and manage your schedule.
