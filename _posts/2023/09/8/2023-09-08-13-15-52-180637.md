In this blog post, we will explore how to compute **Bernoulli numbers** and **Euler numbers** using the `mpmath` library in Python. The `mpmath` library provides a high-precision arithmetic module for performing mathematical operations with arbitrary precision.

## What are Bernoulli Numbers?

Bernoulli numbers, denoted as `Bn`, are a sequence of rational numbers that appear in various areas of mathematics, including number theory, combinatorics, and calculus. They can be defined using the generating function:

```
B(z) = z / (e^z - 1)
```

where `e` is the mathematical constant Euler's number.

## Calculating Bernoulli Numbers

To calculate Bernoulli numbers using `mpmath`, we can use the `bernpoly` function in combination with the `bernoulli` function. The `bernpoly` function generates the Bernoulli polynomial of degree `n`, and the `bernoulli` function evaluates the polynomial at `x=0`.

Here's an example code snippet to calculate the first 10 Bernoulli numbers:

```python
import mpmath

mp.dps = 50  # Set the precision

n = 10  # Number of Bernoulli numbers to calculate
B = []

for i in range(n):
    poly = mpmath.bernpoly(i)
    bn = mpmath.bernoulli(0, poly)
    B.append(bn)

print(B)
```

In this example, we set the precision (`mp.dps`) to 50 decimal places. We then iterate through the range `n` and calculate the corresponding Bernoulli number using `bernpoly` and `bernoulli` functions. The calculated Bernoulli numbers are stored in a list `B`.

## What are Euler Numbers?

Euler numbers, denoted as `En`, are another sequence of numbers that arise in various areas of mathematics, such as number theory and algebra. They can be defined using the generating function:

```
E(z) = 2 * (e^z + 1) / (e^z - 1)
```

## Calculating Euler Numbers

Similar to Bernoulli numbers, we can calculate Euler numbers using the `mpmath` library. We can use the `eulernum` function to directly calculate the `n`th Euler number.

Here's an example code snippet to calculate the first 10 Euler numbers:

```python
import mpmath

mp.dps = 50  # Set the precision

n = 10  # Number of Euler numbers to calculate
E = []

for i in range(n):
    en = mpmath.eulernum(i)
    E.append(en)

print(E)
```

In this code snippet, we again set the precision to 50 decimal places. We iterate through the range `n` and calculate each Euler number using the `eulernum` function. The calculated Euler numbers are stored in a list `E`.

By using the `mpmath` library, we can easily compute Bernoulli numbers and Euler numbers with high precision in Python. These mathematical calculations are crucial in various advanced mathematical applications and research fields.
