Regular expressions, or regex, are a powerful tool for pattern matching and string manipulation. In Python, the `re` module provides built-in support for working with regex. Understanding the operator precedence in regex is important to write effective and efficient regular expressions. Let's dive into the various regex operators and their priority in Python.

## Regex Operators and Their Priority

1. `()` - Parentheses: Parentheses are used for grouping and capturing. Anything inside parentheses is treated as a single unit.
2. `[]` - Character classes: Character classes allow you to match any single character from a set of characters.
3. `{}` - Quantifiers: Quantifiers specify the number of times a particular element should occur. For example, `{3,5}` matches between 3 to 5 occurrences of the preceding element.
4. `?`, `*`, `+`, and `{}` - Greedy and Lazy Quantifiers: These quantifiers control the greediness of the matches. `?`, `*`, and `+` are greedy by default, meaning they match as much as possible. Adding a `?` after them makes them lazy, matching as little as possible.
5. `^` and `$` - Anchors: `^` matches the start of a line, and `$` matches the end of a line.
6. `|` - Alternation: Alternation allows you to match one pattern or another. For example, `(A|B)` matches either "A" or "B".
7. `\`- Escape Sequence: Backslash is used as an escape character to match special characters literally. For example, `\.` matches a dot character.
8. `.` - Dot: Matches any single character except for a newline.
9. `[]` - Character Ranges: Inside square brackets, a hyphen `-` denotes a range of characters. For example, `[0-9]` matches any digit.
10. `\b`, `\B`, `\d`, `\D`, `\w`, `\W`, `\s`, `\S` - Special Sequences: These are shorthand notations for commonly used character classes.

## Example Usage

Now, let's see an example of how we can use these operators in a Python program:

```python
import re

# Search for a pattern in a string
string = "Hello, World!"
pattern = r"Hello"
result = re.search(pattern, string)
print(result.group())  # Output: Hello

# Replace a pattern in a string
new_string = re.sub(pattern, "Hi", string)
print(new_string)  # Output: Hi, World!

# Validate an email address using regex
email = "example@example.com"
email_pattern = r"^\w+@[a-zA-Z_]+?\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}$"
is_valid_email = re.match(email_pattern, email)
if is_valid_email:
    print("Valid email address")
else:
    print("Invalid email address")
```

This example showcases the use of various regex operators and demonstrates how they can be used for pattern matching and string manipulation.

Remember that understanding the operator precedence is crucial to write efficient and accurate regular expressions. Experiment and practice with different regex expressions to become proficient in using them for your specific use cases.

I hope this article helped you understand the priority of regex operators in Python. Happy coding with regex!
