Sympy is a powerful Python library for symbolic mathematics. It provides various tools for manipulating mathematical expressions, solving equations, and performing other symbolic computations. One of the key features of Sympy is the ability to expand and manipulate series.

## What is a Series in Sympy?

In mathematics, a series is an infinite sum of terms. Sympy allows you to work with series by representing them as symbolic expressions. These series can be easily manipulated and operated upon just like other Sympy expressions.

## Series Expansion in Sympy

Sympy provides the `series` function to expand an expression into a series. The `series` function takes the expression and the variable to expand around as arguments. It also allows you to specify the number of terms in the series expansion.

Here's an example of expanding a simple expression using the `series` function:

```python
import sympy as sp

x = sp.symbols('x')
expr = sp.sin(x)
series_expansion = sp.series(expr, x, 0, 5)
print(series_expansion)
```

The above code will output the series expansion of `sin(x)` around `x = 0` up to 5 terms. This will give you the Taylor series approximation of `sin(x)` near `x = 0`.

## Manipulating Series in Sympy

Once you have expanded a series, you can manipulate it using various Sympy methods. You can perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and differentiation on series expressions.

Here's an example of adding two series expressions:

```python
import sympy as sp

x = sp.symbols('x')
series1 = sp.series(sp.sin(x), x, 0, 5)
series2 = sp.series(sp.cos(x), x, 0, 5)
result = series1 + series2
print(result)
```

The above code will add the series expansions of `sin(x)` and `cos(x)` and print the resulting series.

## Conclusion

Sympy's series expansion functionality allows you to work with infinite sums of terms in a convenient and efficient manner. You can expand expressions into series, manipulate them using Sympy's methods, and perform various operations on them. This makes Sympy a powerful tool for symbolic computations involving series.
