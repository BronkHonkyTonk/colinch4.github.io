FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python, based on standard Python type hints. One important aspect of developing applications with FastAPI is managing the application configuration. In this blog post, we will discuss different approaches to handle configuration in FastAPI applications.

## 1. Environment Variables

Using environment variables is a common and flexible way to manage configuration in a FastAPI application. You can define a set of variables to store configuration values and retrieve them within your application.

```python
# main.py
import os

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
    return {"api_key": api_key}
```

In the above example, the `API_KEY` configuration value is retrieved using the `os.getenv()` function. You can set the environment variables using command-line tools or configuration files depending on your deployment environment.

## 2. Configuration Files

Using configuration files provides a structured way to manage configuration parameters in FastAPI applications. You can store configuration values in a separate file, such as YAML, JSON, or INI, and load them into your application.

```python
# main.py
import yaml

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

def load_config():
    with open("config.yaml") as file:
        config = yaml.safe_load(file)
    return config

config = load_config()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    api_key = config["api_key"]
    return {"api_key": api_key}
```

In the above example, the `config.yaml` file contains the configuration values in YAML format. The `load_config()` function loads and returns the configuration as a dictionary. The values can then be accessed within the application using the dictionary keys.

## 3. Python Modules

Another way to manage configuration in FastAPI applications is by using Python modules. You can create a separate module to store the configuration values, import it, and access the values directly.

```python
# config.py
api_key = "your_api_key"
database_url = "your_database_url"
```

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI

from config import api_key

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"api_key": api_key}
```

In the above example, the `config.py` module stores the configuration values as variables. The `api_key` variable is imported into the `main.py` file and used within the application.

## Conclusion

Managing configuration in FastAPI applications is crucial for building flexible and scalable web APIs. In this blog post, we discussed three common approaches: using environment variables, configuration files, and Python modules. Choose the method that suits your application requirements and development workflow.
