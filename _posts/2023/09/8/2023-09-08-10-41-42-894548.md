![Google Cloud Workload Identity](https://www.gstatic.com/devrel-devsite/prod/v9a1a2a9fc37bec75cbe51cdced238d95a034db270069fda5cfdf1e80672a9f6c/cloud/images/cloud-logo.svg)

Google Cloud Workload Identity is a feature that allows you to securely authenticate your applications *within* Google Cloud Platform (GCP) without the need for managing and distributing service account keys. With Workload Identity, you can associate a Google Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management) service account with a *Kubernetes Service Account* (KSA). This allows your application to access Google Cloud resources using the KSA's identity.

In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage Workload Identity for authentication and authorization in Python using the Google Cloud Client Libraries.

## Prerequisites

- A GCP project with appropriate IAM roles to create and manage service accounts and Kubernetes Service Accounts.
- Python interpreter installed on your machine.
- Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated.

## Setting Up Workload Identity

1. Enable Workload Identity on your Kubernetes Engine cluster by running the following command:

    ```bash
    gcloud container clusters update [CLUSTER_NAME] --workload-pool=[PROJECT_ID].svc.id.goog
    ```

   Replace `[CLUSTER_NAME]` with the name of your cluster and `[PROJECT_ID]` with your GCP project ID.

2. Create a Kubernetes Service Account that you want to associate with a Google Cloud IAM service account:

    ```bash
    kubectl create serviceaccount [KSA_NAME]
    ```

   Replace `[KSA_NAME]` with the desired Kubernetes Service Account name.

3. Annotate the Kubernetes Service Account with the Google Cloud IAM service account email address as follows:

    ```bash
    kubectl annotate serviceaccount [KSA_NAME] iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]
    ```

   Replace `[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]` with the email address of the Google Cloud IAM service account you want to associate.

4. Bind the necessary IAM roles to the Google Cloud IAM service account using the following command:

    ```bash
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] --role=[IAM_ROLE]
    ```

   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your GCP project ID, `[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]` with the email address of the Google Cloud IAM service account, and `[IAM_ROLE]` with the desired IAM role.

## Authenticating with Workload Identity in Python

Now let's see how we can authenticate with Workload Identity in Python using the Google Cloud Client Libraries:

First, ensure that you have installed the necessary libraries using the `pip` package manager:

```bash
pip install google-auth google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib google-cloud-storage
```

Then, you can use the following code snippet to authenticate using Workload Identity:

```python
from google.auth import impersonated_credentials
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request

# Target service account to impersonate
target_service_account_email = "[TARGET_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# Get the default credentials
credentials, project_id = google.auth.default()

# Impersonate the target service account
source_credentials = credentials.with_subject(target_service_account_email)
impersonated_credentials = impersonated_credentials.Credentials(source_credentials=source_credentials, target_principal=target_service_account_email)

# Refresh the impersonated credentials
impersonated_credentials.refresh(Request())

# Use the impersonated credentials to access Google Cloud resources
storage_client = storage.Client(credentials=impersonated_credentials, project=project_id)
bucket = storage_client.get_bucket("[BUCKET_NAME]")
```

Replace `[TARGET_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]` with the email address of the targeted Google Cloud IAM service account, `[PROJECT_ID]` with your GCP project ID, and `[BUCKET_NAME]` with the name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket you want to access.

## Conclusion

Google Cloud Workload Identity provides a secure and convenient way to authenticate and manage access to Google Cloud resources from within your application running in a Kubernetes cluster. By leveraging Workload Identity in Python, you can simplify authentication and authorization processes, improve security, and streamline your application deployment workflow.

In this blog post, we explored the steps to set up and authenticate with Workload Identity in Python using the Google Cloud Client Libraries. We also provided example code to demonstrate the authentication process using impersonated credentials.
