FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. It comes with a lot of powerful features and built-in tools that make API development efficient and enjoyable. One such feature is the ability to customize responses to suit our specific needs.

In this blog post, we will explore how to customize responses in FastAPI using Python.

## Customizing Response Format

FastAPI allows us to define the response format using Pydantic models. By defining a model for the response data, we can enforce the structure and data types of the response. Here's an example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    quantity: int

@app.get("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item)
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    return {"name": "Foo", "price": 10.5, "quantity": 5}
```

In the example above, we defined a Pydantic model `Item` with three attributes: `name`, `price`, and `quantity`. The `read_item` endpoint returns a dictionary with these attributes. FastAPI automatically converts the dictionary to the specified model and validates the response against it.

## Customizing Response Headers

FastAPI allows us to add custom headers to the response using the `Response` class from the `fastapi.responses` module. Here's an example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    headers = {
        "X-Custom-Header": "Custom Value",
        "Content-Language": "en-US"
    }
    return JSONResponse(content={"message": "Hello, World!"}, headers=headers)
```

In the example above, the `/` endpoint returns a JSON response with the message "Hello, World!" and custom headers `X-Custom-Header` and `Content-Language`.

## Customizing Response Status Code

FastAPI allows us to customize the response status code using the `status_code` parameter in the `Response` class. Here's an example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import Response

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    if item_id == 0:
        return Response(content="Item not found", status_code=404)
    return Response(content="Item found", status_code=200)
```

In the example above, the `/items/{item_id}` endpoint returns a response with a dynamic status code based on the `item_id` parameter. If `item_id` is 0, the response status code will be 404 (Not Found), otherwise, it will be 200 (OK).

## Conclusion

FastAPI provides powerful tools to customize API responses according to our requirements. We can define the response format using Pydantic models, add custom headers using the `Response` class, and customize the response status code. This flexibility allows us to create robust and well-structured APIs with minimal effort.
