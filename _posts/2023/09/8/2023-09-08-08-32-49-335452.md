Python's built-in `collections` module provides the `Counter` class, which is a powerful tool for counting and analyzing elements in an iterable. One of the most useful methods of the `Counter` class is `most_common`, which returns the most common elements and their counts in a collection.

## How to use most_common()

The `most_common` method returns a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of an element and its count. The list is sorted in descending order based on the count.

Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of `most_common`:

```python
from collections import Counter

# Create a Counter object
my_counter = Counter(['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'banana'])

# Use most_common to get the most common elements
most_common_elements = my_counter.most_common()

print(most_common_elements)
```

Output:
```
[('banana', 3), ('apple', 2), ('orange', 1)]
```

In the example above, we created a `Counter` object called `my_counter` by passing a list of fruits. We then used the `most_common` method to retrieve the most common elements and their counts in descending order.

## Retrieving a specific number of common elements

By default, `most_common` returns all elements in the counter. However, you can pass an argument to specify the number of elements you want to retrieve.

Here's an example:

```python
from collections import Counter

# Create a Counter object
my_counter = Counter(['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'banana'])

# Use most_common to get the top 2 most common elements
top_2_elements = my_counter.most_common(2)

print(top_2_elements)
```

Output:
```
[('banana', 3), ('apple', 2)]
```

In the above example, we passed `2` as an argument to `most_common`, so it only returned the two most common elements with their counts.

## Conclusion

The `most_common` method of the `collections.Counter` class in Python is a handy tool for finding the most common elements in a collection. It provides a simple way to analyze and extract valuable information from data.
