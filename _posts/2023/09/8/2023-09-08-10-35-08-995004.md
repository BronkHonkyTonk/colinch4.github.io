Google Cloud Deployment Manager is a powerful tool that allows you to automate the deployment of resources on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By using Deployment Manager, you can define your infrastructure as code, making it easier to manage and reproduce deployments.

In this blog post, we will walk through an example of how to automate the deployment of resources using Deployment Manager with Python.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this example, you will need:
- A Google Cloud Platform account
- Basic knowledge of Python and GCP concepts

## Step 1: Install the required libraries

First, make sure you have the Google Cloud SDK installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

Once the SDK is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required Python libraries:

```python
pip install --upgrade google-cloud
```

## Step 2: Write the Deployment Manager configuration file

Deployment Manager uses YAML or Python templates to define the resources you want to deploy. In this example, we will use a Python template.

Create a new file called `config.py` and add the following code:

```python
config = {
    'resources': [{
        'name': 'my-instance',
        'type': 'compute.v1.instance',
        'properties': {
            'zone': 'us-central1-a',
            'machineType': 'n1-standard-1',
            'disks': [{
                'deviceName': 'boot',
                'type': 'PERSISTENT',
                'boot': True,
                'autoDelete': True,
                'initializeParams': {
                    'sourceImage': 'projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-10'
                }
            }],
            'networkInterfaces': [{
                'network': 'global/networks/default',
                'accessConfigs': [{
                    'name': 'External NAT',
                    'type': 'ONE_TO_ONE_NAT'
                }]
            }]
        }
    }]
}
```

This configuration file defines a single resource, an instance of a virtual machine, with specific properties such as the machine type, disks, and networking.

## Step 3: Write the deployment script

Create a new file called `deploy.py` and add the following code:

```python
from google.cloud import deploymentmanager_v2 as deploymentmanager

def create_deployment(project_id, deployment_name, config):
    deploymentmanager_client = deploymentmanager.DeploymentManagerClient()

    parent = f"projects/{project_id}/locations/global"

    deployment = deploymentmanager.Deployment(
        name=deployment_name,
        target=parent,
        config=config
    )

    operation = deploymentmanager_client.create_deployment(
        parent=parent,
        deployment=deployment
    )

    operation.result()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    project_id = '<your-project-id>'
    deployment_name = 'my-deployment'
    config = '<path-to-config-file>'

    create_deployment(project_id, deployment_name, config)
```

Replace `<your-project-id>` with your actual GCP project ID and `<path-to-config-file>` with the path to your `config.py` file.

This script uses the Google Cloud Python library to interact with the Deployment Manager API and creates a deployment based on the given configuration file.

## Step 4: Deploy the resources

To deploy the resources defined in the configuration file, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python deploy.py
```

This will execute the `create_deployment` function and create the specified resources in your GCP project.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have seen how to automate the deployment of resources on Google Cloud Platform using Deployment Manager and Python. By defining your infrastructure as code, you can easily manage, version, and reproduce your deployments. Deployment Manager provides a powerful and flexible way to automate your infrastructure deployments in a consistent and repeatable manner.
