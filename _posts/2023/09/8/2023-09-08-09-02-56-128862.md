FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. With FastAPI, you can easily create APIs with automatic serialization/deserialization and data validation. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform data validation using FastAPI.

## Data Validation in FastAPI

Data validation is an essential process in any API application to ensure that the incoming data is accurate and conforms to the expected format. FastAPI provides a convenient way to perform data validation using Python's type hints.

### Declaring Request Models

To perform data validation, you need to declare request models using Pydantic. Pydantic is a great library that provides data validation and parsing based on Python type annotations and can be easily integrated with FastAPI.

Let's create a simple example where we have a `User` model with two fields: `name` (str) and `age` (int).

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
```

### Using Request Models in API Endpoints

To use the request model for data validation in FastAPI, you simply need to include the model as a function parameter in your API endpoint. FastAPI will automatically validate the incoming data against the declared model.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/users")
async def create_user(user: User):
    # Access the validated user data
    user_name = user.name
    user_age = user.age
    # Process the user data and return a response
    return {"message": "User created successfully"}
```

In the above example, the `create_user` endpoint expects a POST request to `/users` with a JSON payload containing the `name` and `age` fields. FastAPI will automatically deserialize the JSON payload into the `User` model and validate the data against the specified types. If the data does not match the expected types, FastAPI will return a 422 Unprocessable Entity response with detailed validation errors.

### Handling Validation Errors

When validation fails, FastAPI will return a detailed error message explaining what went wrong. The error response will include the path to the invalid field, the type error, and an example of the expected data.

```json
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "loc": [
        "body",
        "user",
        "age"
      ],
      "msg": "value is not a valid integer",
      "type": "type_error.integer"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the example above, the validation error occurred in the `age` field of the `user` object in the request body. The error message specifies that the value is not a valid integer.

### Additional Validation Rules

In addition to basic type validation, Pydantic provides a range of validation capabilities such as length validation, regular expression validation, and more. You can define these validation rules directly in the request model by using Pydantic validators or standard Python annotations.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., max_length=50, description="User's name")
    age: int = Field(..., gt=0, description="User's age (must be greater than zero)")
```

In the example above, we have added additional validation rules to the `name` and `age` fields. The `name` field must have a maximum length of 50 characters, and the `age` field must be greater than zero.

### Conclusion

FastAPI's integration with Pydantic makes data validation in Python APIs a breeze. By leveraging Python's type hints and Pydantic's powerful validation capabilities, you can easily ensure the integrity of your API's data. With FastAPI's automatic serialization/deserialization, you can focus on building robust APIs without worrying about data validation.
