In this blog post, we will explore how to create a file system in Python using the **pycrypto** library for encryption.

## Introduction to pycrypto

**pycrypto** is a powerful library that provides encryption and cryptographic functions in Python. It supports a wide range of cryptographic algorithms, including AES, RSA, and SHA. We will be using pycrypto's AES module to encrypt and decrypt our files.

## Creating a file system

To create a file system, we will use the **os** module in Python to interact with the file system. We will also use pycrypto's AES module for encryption and decryption.

### Setup

Before we begin, we need to install the pycrypto library. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
pip install pycrypto
```

### Encryption and Decryption

First, we need to define two functions: `encrypt_file` and `decrypt_file`. These functions will be responsible for encrypting and decrypting our files.

```python
import os
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad, unpad

def encrypt_file(file_path, key):
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)
    
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        plaintext = file.read()
    
    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(pad(plaintext, AES.block_size))
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(ciphertext)

def decrypt_file(file_path, key):
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)
    
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        ciphertext = file.read()
    
    plaintext = unpad(cipher.decrypt(ciphertext), AES.block_size)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(plaintext)
```

In the `encrypt_file` function, we create an AES cipher object using the provided key. We then read the file and pad the plaintext to be a multiple of the block size. We encrypt the plaintext and write the ciphertext back to the file.

In the `decrypt_file` function, we do the reverse process. We create an AES cipher object, read the ciphertext, decrypt it, and remove the padding. Finally, we write the plaintext back to the file.

### Creating a File System

Now that we have our encryption and decryption functions, let's create a simple file system that uses these functions.

```python
import os

def create_directory(directory):
    if not os.path.exists(directory):
        os.makedirs(directory)
        print(f"Created directory: {directory}")
    else:
        print(f"Directory already exists: {directory}")

def encrypt_directory(directory, key):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            encrypt_file(file_path, key)
            print(f"Encrypted file: {file_path}")

def decrypt_directory(directory, key):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            decrypt_file(file_path, key)
            print(f"Decrypted file: {file_path}")
```

We start by defining a `create_directory` function that creates a directory if it doesn't already exist.

Then, the `encrypt_directory` function takes a directory path and a key as input. It iterates through all the files in the directory (including subdirectories) and encrypts each file using the `encrypt_file` function.

Similarly, the `decrypt_directory` function iterates through each file in the directory (including subdirectories) and decrypts the file using the `decrypt_file` function.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to create a file system in Python using the pycrypto library for encryption. We learned how to encrypt and decrypt files using AES encryption. This simple file system can be extended and customized to fit your specific needs, such as adding authentication or implementing more advanced encryption algorithms.

Remember to use encryption responsibly and handle encryption keys securely.
