In Python, you can use the `datetime` module to work with dates and times. To get the current time in a specific timezone, you can utilize the `pytz` library along with the `datetime` module.

Here's an example of obtaining the current time in different timezones using Python:

## Install `pytz` library
Before getting started, make sure you have the `pytz` library installed. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running the following command:

```python
pip install pytz
```

## Example Code
Now, let's see an example of how to get the current time in different timezones:

```python
import datetime
import pytz

def get_current_time(timezone):
    current_time = datetime.datetime.now(pytz.timezone(timezone))
    return current_time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# Usage
print("Current time in New York: ", get_current_time("America/New_York"))
print("Current time in London: ", get_current_time("Europe/London"))
print("Current time in Tokyo: ", get_current_time("Asia/Tokyo"))
```

In the above code, we first import the necessary modules: `datetime` and `pytz`. We define a function `get_current_time` that takes a timezone as an argument and returns the current time in that timezone.

To obtain the current time in a specific timezone, we pass the timezone as an argument to `datetime.datetime.now()` method. We then format the resulting datetime object using `strftime()` function to display it in a human-readable format.

In the usage section, we call the `get_current_time` function passing different timezones as arguments, and print the current time in each timezone.

You can replace the timezone values with your desired timezones from the [List of tz database time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

## Conclusion
Obtaining the current time in different timezones is made simple using the `datetime` module in Python along with the `pytz` library. By utilizing this code snippet, you can easily display the accurate current time for specific timezones in your Python applications.

Remember to install the `pytz` library before running the code. Enjoy working with timezones in Python!
