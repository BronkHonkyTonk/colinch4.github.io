In Python, decorators are a powerful feature that allows you to modify the behavior of functions or classes without changing their source code. One common use case for decorators is to add additional functionality to a function. One aspect of this additional functionality is managing and maintaining state within the decorator.

In this blog post, we will explore how to manage state internally within a functools decorator in Python.

## What is functools?

`functools` is a Python module that provides a set of higher-order functions (functions that operate on other functions) that are used to manipulate functions and provide additional functionality. One of the notable features in `functools` is the ability to create and apply decorators.

## Understanding decorators

Before diving into managing state within a decorator, let's quickly recap what decorators are in Python.

In Python, a decorator is a design pattern that allows adding new functionality to an existing function or class. It is expressed using the "@" symbol followed by the decorator name, which is placed just before the declaration of the function or class.

Here's a simple example of a decorator that prints a message before and after a function is called:

```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Before function call")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After function call")
        return result
    return wrapper

@decorator
def my_function():
    print("Inside my_function")

my_function()
```

Output:
```
Before function call
Inside my_function
After function call
```

## Managing state within a decorator

Now, let's discuss how to manage state within a decorator. One common scenario is to keep track of the number of times a function is called. Let's modify our previous decorator to keep track of the count:

```python
import functools

def count_calls(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        wrapper.count += 1
        print(f"Function called {wrapper.count} times")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    
    wrapper.count = 0
    return wrapper

@count_calls
def my_function():
    print("Inside my_function")

my_function()
my_function()
my_function()
```

Output:
```
Function called 1 times
Inside my_function
Function called 2 times
Inside my_function
Function called 3 times
Inside my_function
```

In the above example, we define a `count_calls` decorator that keeps track of the count using the `wrapper.count` attribute. This attribute is created outside the inner function and can be accessed from within the wrapper function.

By using `functools.wraps`, we ensure that the decorated function retains its original name and docstring.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to manage and maintain state within a functools decorator in Python. Decorators provide a powerful way to add functionality to functions or classes, and by managing state, we can enhance their capabilities even further.

Understanding how to manage state within decorators opens up a wide range of possibilities for customization and flexibility in your code. It allows you to create decorators that can remember information across multiple invocations and make decisions based on this information.

So go ahead and leverage the power of decorators and start building more dynamic and adaptable code in Python!
