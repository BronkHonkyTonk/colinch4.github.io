Sympy is a powerful Python library for symbolic mathematics. It provides various functionalities for symbolic computation, including transformation and substitution of expressions. In this blog post, we will explore the `subs` method in Sympy, which allows us to replace one symbol or expression with another within our mathematical expressions.

## Understanding the `subs` method

The `subs` method in Sympy is used to perform substitutions. It replaces one symbol or expression with another in a given expression. It takes two parameters:

1. **`old`**: The symbol or expression we want to replace.
2. **`new`**: The symbol or expression we want to substitute.

The `subs` method returns a new expression with the desired substitution.

Let's see how it works with some examples.

## Example 1: Substituting a symbol

```python
from sympy import symbols

# Define symbols
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Define an expression
expr = x**2 + y**2

# Substitute x with y
expr_new = expr.subs(x, y)

print(expr_new)
```

Output:
```
2⋅y**2
```

In this example, we defined two symbols `x` and `y`. We then created an expression `expr` using these symbols. Finally, we used the `subs` method to substitute `x` with `y` in the expression. The result `expr_new` is `2*y**2`.

## Example 2: Substituting an expression

```python
from sympy import symbols, sin

# Define symbols
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Define an expression
expr = sin(x) + sin(y)

# Substitute sin(x) with 2*sin(x)
expr_new = expr.subs(sin(x), 2*sin(x))

print(expr_new)
```

Output:
```
2*sin(x) + sin(y)
```

In this example, we defined two symbols `x` and `y`. We also used the `sin` function from SymPy to create an expression `expr`. Then, we substituted `sin(x)` with `2*sin(x)` using the `subs` method. The resulting expression `expr_new` is `2*sin(x) + sin(y)`.

## Example 3: Substituting multiple symbols

```python
from sympy import symbols

# Define symbols
x, y, z = symbols('x y z')

# Define an expression
expr = x**2 + y**2 + z**2

# Substitute x, y, and z with 1
expr_new = expr.subs([(x, 1), (y, 1), (z, 1)])

print(expr_new)
```

Output:
```
3
```

In this example, we defined three symbols `x`, `y`, and `z`. We created an expression `expr` using these symbols. Then, we used the `subs` method to substitute `x`, `y`, and `z` with `1` using a list of tuples. The resulting expression `expr_new` is `3`.

## Conclusion

The `subs` method in Sympy provides a convenient way to perform substitutions in mathematical expressions. Whether you want to substitute a single symbol, an expression, or multiple symbols, the `subs` method simplifies the process. It enables you to manipulate and transform mathematical expressions effortlessly.
