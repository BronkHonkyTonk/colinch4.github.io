In Python, decorators are a powerful way to modify the behavior of functions or classes. The `functools` module provides a collection of higher-order functions that can be used to manipulate or extend the functionalities of decorators. In this blog post, we will explore how to create a custom decorator using the `functools` module.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into creating a custom decorator, make sure you have a basic understanding of Python decorators and the `functools` module. If you need a refresher, the official Python documentation is a great resource to start with.

## Creating a Decorator

Let's start by creating a simple decorator. We will create a decorator function called `my_decorator` that will print the name of the decorated function before and after it is called.

```python
import functools

def my_decorator(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling function: {func.__name__}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} called")
        return result
    return wrapper
```

In the above code, we import the `functools` module and use the `wraps` function as a decorator to preserve the original function's name and docstring. This ensures that the decorated function retains its identity.

The `my_decorator` function takes a single argument, `func`, which represents the function being decorated. Inside the `my_decorator` function, we define an inner function called `wrapper`. This inner function will be the actual wrapper that adds functionality to the original function.

Within the `wrapper` function, we first print the name of the decorated function before calling it. We then call the original function `func` with the provided arguments and store the result in a variable `result`. Finally, we print the name of the function after it is called and return the result.

## Usage

Now that we have created our custom decorator, let's see how to use it.

```python
@my_decorator
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("John")
```

When we run the above code, the output will be:

```
Calling function: greet
Hello, John!
Function greet called
```

As you can see, the `my_decorator` decorator is applied to the `greet` function using the `@` symbol. When we call the `greet` function with the argument "John", the decorator adds functionality to print the name before and after the function call.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to create a custom decorator using the `functools` module in Python. Decorators allow us to extend or modify the behavior of functions or classes without explicitly modifying their code. The `functools` module provides the necessary tools to create powerful decorators with ease.
