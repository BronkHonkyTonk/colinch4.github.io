In this blog post, we will explore how to use the **pycrypto** library in Python for text and file encryption. **PyCrypto** is a library that provides cryptographic algorithms and protocols for Python, allowing us to secure our sensitive information.

## Installing pycrypto

To begin, we need to install the **pycrypto** library. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```shell
pip install pycrypto
```

## Text Encryption using pycrypto

Let's start with the encryption of text using **pycrypto**. Here is an example code that demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt a text message:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

def encrypt_text(key, plain_text):
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX)
    nonce = cipher.nonce
    ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(plain_text.encode())
    return nonce + ciphertext + tag

def decrypt_text(key, ciphertext):
    nonce = ciphertext[:16]
    tag = ciphertext[-16:]
    ciphertext = ciphertext[16:-16]
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX, nonce)
    decrypted_text = cipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, tag)
    return decrypted_text.decode()

# Example usage
key = get_random_bytes(16)  # 16 bytes key for AES-128
text = "Hello, World!"

encrypted_text = encrypt_text(key, text)
decrypted_text = decrypt_text(key, encrypted_text)

print("Encrypted Text:", encrypted_text)
print("Decrypted Text:", decrypted_text)
```

In the above code, we use the **AES** cipher from **Crypto.Cipher** module to perform encryption and decryption. We generate a random initialization vector (nonce) using **get_random_bytes** from **Crypto.Random** module. The encrypted text includes the nonce, ciphertext, and a tag for integrity verification.

## File Encryption using pycrypto

Now, let's move on to file encryption using **pycrypto**. Here is an example code that demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt a file:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

def encrypt_file(key, input_file, output_file):
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX)
    nonce = cipher.nonce
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as file:
        plaintext = file.read()
        ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(plaintext)
    with open(output_file, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(nonce + ciphertext + tag)

def decrypt_file(key, input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as file:
        ciphertext = file.read()
        nonce = ciphertext[:16]
        tag = ciphertext[-16:]
        ciphertext = ciphertext[16:-16]
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX, nonce)
    decrypted_text = cipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, tag)
    with open(output_file, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(decrypted_text)

# Example usage
key = get_random_bytes(16)  # 16 bytes key for AES-128
input_file = "plain_text.txt"
encrypted_file = "encrypted_file.bin"
decrypted_file = "decrypted_file.txt"

encrypt_file(key, input_file, encrypted_file)
decrypt_file(key, encrypted_file, decrypted_file)

print("File encrypted successfully!")
```

In the above code, we read the content of the input file as plaintext. Then, we encrypt the plaintext using the **AES** cipher and write the encrypted data to the output file. During decryption, we read the encrypted file, extract the nonce and tag, and then decrypt the ciphertext to retrieve the original file contents.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to use the **pycrypto** library to perform text and file encryption in Python. Encryption is essential for protecting sensitive data and ensuring its confidentiality. **PyCrypto** provides a powerful and easy-to-use interface for implementing encryption in your Python applications.

Remember, encryption alone may not be sufficient for complete security. It is crucial to handle encryption keys securely and implement other security practices to safeguard your data effectively.
