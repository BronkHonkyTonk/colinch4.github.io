FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for developing web applications and supports various features such as type hints, request validation, and automatic API documentation. Additionally, FastAPI allows the use of middleware to modify and process requests and responses.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use middleware in FastAPI to further enhance our web applications.

## What is Middleware?

Middleware, in the context of web frameworks, is a piece of code that sits between the server and the actual application. It intercepts requests and responses, allowing us to perform additional processing before the request reaches the application or after the response is generated. This can be useful for tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and more.

## Using Middleware in FastAPI

FastAPI provides a straightforward way to use middleware through the `Starlette` framework. `Starlette` is a lightweight asynchronous framework that powers FastAPI and allows us to define middleware in our application.

To demonstrate the usage of middleware in FastAPI, let's consider a simple example of logging incoming requests:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import Response

app = FastAPI()

class LoggingMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        # Log the incoming request
        print(f"Incoming request: {request.method} {request.url}")

        response = await call_next(request)

        # Log the response
        print(f"Outgoing response: {response.status_code}")

        return response

app.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware)

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello, World!"}
```

In the above example, we define a custom middleware, `LoggingMiddleware`, inherited from `BaseHTTPMiddleware`. The `dispatch` method is called for each request and response, allowing us to add our own custom logic. In this case, we log the incoming request and the outgoing response.

We then add the `LoggingMiddleware` middleware to the FastAPI application using the `add_middleware` method.

Finally, we define a simple endpoint, `/`, that returns a JSON response.

## Conclusion

FastAPI's support for middleware allows us to extend our applications with additional functionality and implement common tasks like logging, authentication, and more. By leveraging the power of middleware, we can create more powerful and flexible APIs.
