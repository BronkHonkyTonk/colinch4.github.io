## Introduction

In modern web development, having an API is an essential part of building scalable and flexible applications. Django Rest Framework (DRF) is a powerful framework for building APIs in Python. However, once your API is up and running, it becomes crucial to monitor and track its performance. 

In this blog post, we will explore how to monitor a DRF API and create a dashboard using Python. We will cover the following topics:

1. Setting up monitoring libraries
2. Collecting API performance metrics
3. Visualizing metrics in a dashboard

## Setting up monitoring libraries

To monitor our DRF API, we need to install and configure some monitoring libraries. One popular library for performance monitoring is **Prometheus**. Follow these steps to set up Prometheus:

1. Install Prometheus using pip:

```python
pip install prometheus_client
```

2. Configure Prometheus in your Django settings:

```python
# settings.py

...

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_prometheus',
    ...
]

...

MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...
    'django_prometheus.middleware.PrometheusBeforeMiddleware',
    ...
]
```

3. Run your Django application with the Prometheus exporter:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Collecting API performance metrics

Now that we have set up Prometheus, we can collect metrics from our DRF API. We will use the **Django Prometheus library** to collect the following metrics:

- Request count
- Request duration
- Error count

To collect these metrics, follow these steps:

1. Import the Prometheus library in your views:

```python
from django_prometheus import exports

@exports('api_request_count')
@exports('api_request_latency_seconds')
@exports('api_request_error_count')
def my_view(request):
    ...
```
            
2. Use the decorators above your view functions or class-based views.

```python
@api_view(['GET'])
@measure_latency('api_request_latency_seconds')
def my_view(request):
    ...
```

## Visualizing metrics in a dashboard

Having collected metrics from our DRF API, we can now visualize them in a dashboard. One popular library for dashboard development is **Grafana**. Follow these steps to set up Grafana:

1. Install Grafana by following the instructions [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/).

2. After installing Grafana, open its web interface and add Prometheus as a data source.

3. Create a new dashboard and add graphs or panels to visualize your metrics.

The possibilities with Grafana are vast, and you can create a custom dashboard tailored to your specific needs.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to monitor a DRF API and create a dashboard using Python. By setting up monitoring libraries like Prometheus and visualizing metrics with Grafana, we gain insights into the performance of our API. Monitoring not only helps us track the health of our API but also enables us to make data-driven decisions for optimization and scalability.
