Peewee is a lightweight Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python that simplifies database interaction. It provides a convenient way to interact with databases using Python code, without having to write complex SQL queries.

In this blog post, we will explore how to write complex queries using Peewee. We will cover various scenarios where you might need to write advanced queries and demonstrate how Peewee can handle them efficiently.

## Basic Querying

Before diving into complex queries, let's quickly review basic querying in Peewee. To query records from a table, you can use the `select()` method on the model class. For example, to retrieve all records from a `User` table, you can do:

```python
users = User.select()
```

You can also apply filters to the query using methods like `where()` or `filter()`. For example, to retrieve all users with the name "John", you can do:

```python
users = User.select().where(User.name == 'John')
```

## Complex Querying

### Joins

One common scenario in complex queries is joining multiple tables. Peewee provides an elegant way to perform joins using the `join()` method. For example, to retrieve all orders along with the related customer information, you can do:

```python
orders = Order.select().join(Customer)
```

### Subqueries

Sometimes, you may need to use subqueries to perform more advanced filtering or calculations. Peewee supports subqueries through the `select()` method. Let's say we want to retrieve all users who have placed more than 10 orders. We can achieve this using a subquery:

```python
subquery = Order.select(fn.COUNT(Order.id)).where(Order.user == User.id)

users = User.select().where(subquery > 10)
```

### Aggregations

Peewee also supports aggregations like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, or `AVG()`. You can use these functions with the `annotate()` method to perform calculations on groups of records. For example, to retrieve the total number of orders for each customer, you can do:

```python
query = Order.select(fn.COUNT(Order.id).alias('total_orders'), Customer).join(Customer).group_by(Customer)

results = query.dicts()
```

### Raw Queries

In some cases, you may need to execute raw SQL queries that are not supported by Peewee's ORM methods. Peewee allows you to execute raw queries using the `execute_sql()` method. For example, if you have a complex join query that cannot be expressed using Peewee's `join()` method, you can execute it directly:

```python
query = '''
SELECT * FROM orders 
JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id
WHERE customers.country = 'USA'
'''

results = Order.execute_sql(query)
```

## Conclusion

Peewee is a powerful ORM library that allows you to write complex queries in a simplified manner. In this blog post, we explored various scenarios where you might need to write advanced queries and demonstrated how Peewee can handle them efficiently. By leveraging Peewee's capabilities, you can streamline your database interactions and make your code more readable and maintainable.
