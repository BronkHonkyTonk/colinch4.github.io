SQLAlchemy is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that provides a powerful and expressive way to query relational databases using Python. One of the key features of SQLAlchemy is its flexibility in query composition and chaining. In this blog post, we will explore how to compose complex queries using SQLAlchemy and how to chain multiple query operations together.

## Query Composition

SQLAlchemy allows you to build complex queries by composing smaller query components together. This can be achieved using its query API, which provides a fluent interface for constructing queries.

One of the most basic query components in SQLAlchemy is the `select` statement. With the `select` statement, you can specify the columns to retrieve and the table(s) to query from. Here's an example:

```python
from sqlalchemy import select
from myapp.models import User

# Create a select statement
stmt = select(User).where(User.email == 'example@example.com')

# Execute the query
result = connection.execute(stmt)
```

In the above example, we create a `select` statement that retrieves all columns from the `User` table where the email is equal to 'example@example.com'. We then execute the query by calling `connection.execute(stmt)`.

You can compose more complex queries by combining multiple query components. For example, you can join tables, apply filters, perform aggregations, and so on. SQLAlchemy provides a rich API for all these operations.

## Query Chaining

Another powerful feature of SQLAlchemy is query chaining. With query chaining, you can perform multiple operations on a query object in a single line of code. This allows you to build complex queries in a more readable and concise manner.

Here's an example:

```python
from sqlalchemy import select
from myapp.models import User

# Perform multiple operations on a query in a single line
stmt = select(User).where(User.email == 'example@example.com').order_by(User.created_at.desc()).limit(10)

# Execute the query
result = connection.execute(stmt)
```

In the above example, we chain three operations together on the `select` statement. We first apply a filter to retrieve users with a specific email, then we order the results by the `created_at` column in descending order, and finally, we limit the number of results to 10.

Query chaining allows you to express complex queries in a more readable and concise manner. It also helps to reduce the number of intermediate variables and makes your code more maintainable.

## Conclusion

SQLAlchemy provides a powerful and flexible querying API that allows you to compose complex queries using small query components and chain multiple operations together. This enables you to write expressive and readable code when working with relational databases in Python.
