Tornado is a powerful web framework for building asynchronous web applications in Python. One of the key components in Tornado is the `RequestHandler` class, which handles incoming HTTP requests and generates HTTP responses.

## Getting Started

To use the `RequestHandler` class, you need to create a subclass and override its methods to define the desired behavior. 

Here's an example of a basic `RequestHandler` class:

```python
import tornado.web

class MyRequestHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        self.write("Hello, Tornado!")

# Creating the Tornado application and specifying the routes
app = tornado.web.Application([
    (r"/", MyRequestHandler),
])

# Starting the Tornado server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.listen(8888)
    tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current().start()
```

In the above code, we define a subclass `MyRequestHandler` that inherits from `tornado.web.RequestHandler`. We override the `get` method to handle the incoming GET requests to the URL endpoint "/". Inside the `get` method, we call the `write` method to send the response body to the client.

The `tornado.web.Application` class is used to create the Tornado application and specify the routes. In this example, we map the URL pattern "/" to the `MyRequestHandler` class.

Finally, we start the Tornado server by calling the `listen` method and passing the desired port number. The `IOLoop.current().start()` method starts the server and keeps it running until the process is terminated.

## RequestHandler Methods

The `RequestHandler` class provides various methods that can be overridden to handle different types of HTTP requests:

- `get`: Handles the HTTP GET requests.
- `post`: Handles the HTTP POST requests.
- `put`: Handles the HTTP PUT requests.
- `delete`: Handles the HTTP DELETE requests.
- `head`: Handles the HTTP HEAD requests.
- `options`: Handles the HTTP OPTIONS requests.
- `patch`: Handles the HTTP PATCH requests.

For example, to handle a POST request, you can override the `post` method in your `RequestHandler` subclass:

```python
class MyRequestHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def post(self):
        # Handle the POST request here
```

## Request and Response Handling

Inside the `RequestHandler` subclass, you have access to various attributes and methods for handling requests and generating responses.

- Request Attributes:
  - `self.request.method`: The HTTP method of the current request.
  - `self.request.uri`: The requested URI.
  - `self.request.arguments`: A dictionary of the request arguments.
  - `self.request.headers`: A dictionary of the request headers.
- Response Methods:
  - `self.write(message)`: Writes the response message to the client.
  - `self.set_header(name, value)`: Sets a response header.
  - `self.set_status(status_code)`: Sets the response status code.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we introduced the `RequestHandler` class in Tornado and showed how to create a basic web application using Tornado. We also explored how to handle different types of requests and generate responses. Tornado's `RequestHandler` provides a powerful and flexible way to handle incoming HTTP requests in Python applications.
