Python provides several libraries for working with audio files, including WAV files. One of the most popular libraries for audio processing is `scipy`. In this blog post, we will explore how to read and write WAV files using `scipy` in Python.

## Reading WAV files

To read a WAV file using `scipy`, we need to use the `scipy.io.wavfile` module. Here's an example of how to read a WAV file:

```python
import scipy.io.wavfile as wav

# Specify the path to the WAV file
file_path = 'audio.wav'

# Read the WAV file
sample_rate, audio_data = wav.read(file_path)

# Printing the sample rate and audio data
print("Sample Rate:", sample_rate)
print("Audio Data:", audio_data)
```

In the code above, we imported the `wavfile` module from `scipy.io` and then used the `read` function to read the WAV file. The `read` function returns the sample rate and audio data as separate variables.

## Writing WAV files

To write a WAV file using `scipy`, we can also use the `scipy.io.wavfile` module. Here's an example of how to write audio data to a WAV file:

```python
import scipy.io.wavfile as wav
import numpy as np

# Sample rate and audio data
sample_rate = 44100
audio_data = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, size=(sample_rate,))

# Specify the path to save the WAV file
output_file = 'output.wav'

# Write the audio data to a WAV file
wav.write(output_file, sample_rate, audio_data)
```

In the code above, we generated random audio data using NumPy's `random.uniform` function. We then used the `write` function from `wavfile` module to write the audio data to a WAV file.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to read and write WAV files using `scipy` in Python. The `scipy.io.wavfile` module provides a convenient way to work with audio data in WAV format. With `scipy`, you can easily read and write WAV files for audio processing tasks.
