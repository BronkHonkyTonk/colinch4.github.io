In web scraping and crawling scenarios, it is often necessary to extract specific information from HTML pages. `requests-html` is a powerful Python library that provides an easy and intuitive approach to parse HTML pages and extract data.

## Installation

To get started with `requests-html`, you need to install it. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```python
pip install requests-html
```

Once the installation is complete, you can import `HTMLSession` from `requests_html` module:

```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession
```

## Fetching and Parsing HTML Pages

`HTMLSession` is the main class provided by `requests-html` for making HTTP requests and parsing HTML content. Let's see how to use it to fetch and parse HTML pages.

1. Create an instance of `HTMLSession`:

```python
session = HTMLSession()
```

2. Send an HTTP GET request to a URL using the `get()` method. This method returns an `HTMLResponse` object:

```python
response = session.get('https://example.com')
```

3. Access the HTML content of the response using the `html` property:

```python
html_content = response.html
```

## Extracting Data from HTML Pages

Once you have obtained the HTML content, you can use various methods and properties of the `HTMLResponse` object to extract data from the HTML structure.

### Finding Elements

You can find HTML elements using different methods like `find()`, `find_all()`, and CSS selectors.

```python
# Find the first element matching a specific CSS selector
element = response.html.find('#id-of-element', first=True)

# Find all elements matching a specific CSS selector
elements = response.html.find('.class-of-elements')

# Find all anchor tags
links = response.html.find('a')
```

### Accessing element attributes and text

Once you have obtained an element, you can access its attributes and text using the following properties:

```python
# Get the value of an attribute
attribute_value = element.attrs['attribute-name']

# Get the text content of an element
text_content = element.text
```

## Summary

The `requests-html` library provides a convenient way to fetch and parse HTML pages in Python. With its easy-to-use API, you can quickly extract data from HTML structures using CSS selectors or other methods. Whether you are building web scrapers, performing data analysis, or conducting web automation, `requests-html` is a versatile tool to have in your Python toolkit.
