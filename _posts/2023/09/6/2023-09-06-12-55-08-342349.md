In this blog post, we will explore the concept of 데이터 마이그레이션 (data migration) using the Peewee ORM in Python. 데이터 마이그레이션 refers to the process of transferring data from one version of a database to another.

## What is Peewee?

Peewee is a lightweight ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Python. It provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with a variety of databases, including SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

Peewee makes it easy to define database models as Python classes and perform common database operations such as creating tables, inserting records, querying data, and updating records.

## Why use 데이터 마이그레이션?

As software evolves over time, the structure of a database may change. This could be due to adding new tables, modifying existing tables, or updating the data stored in the tables. 데이터 마이그레이션 ensures that the existing data in the database is seamlessly transformed to match the new structure or data requirements.

With Peewee, we can easily define and execute migrations to ensure smooth transitions between different versions of the database schema.

## How to perform 데이터 마이그레이션 with Peewee

To perform 데이터 마이그레이션 using Peewee, follow these steps:

1. **Create a migration folder**: Start by creating a directory to store your migration files. This folder will contain individual migration scripts that define the changes to be applied to the database schema.

2. **Define a migration script**: Create a new migration script file in the migration folder. In this file, you will define the changes to be applied to the database schema.

3. **Import the necessary modules**: At the top of your migration script, import the required modules such as `peewee` and your database models.

4. **Define the migration class**: Create a class that inherits from `peewee.Migrator` or `peewee.SqliteMigrator`, depending on the database you're using. This class will contain the migration methods.

5. **Define the migration methods**: Inside the migration class, define individual methods for each migration step. These methods can include creating or modifying tables, adding or removing columns, or updating data.

6. **Execute the migration**: Instantiate the migrator class and execute the migration methods in the desired order. Peewee's migration API provides methods like `migrator.create_table()`, `migrator.add_column()`, and `migrator.drop_table()` to perform these operations.

7. **Apply the migration**: Finally, run the migration using the `migrator.run()` method to apply the defined changes to the database schema.

Here's an example of a migration script using Peewee:

```python
from peewee import Migration, SqliteMigrator
from models import User

class Migration001(Migration):
    def up(self):
        migrator = SqliteMigrator(self.database)

        # Add a new column to the User table
        migrator.add_column(User, 'age', User.age)

        # Rename the existing 'email' column to 'email_address'
        migrator.rename_column(User, 'email', 'email_address')

    def down(self):
        migrator = SqliteMigrator(self.database)

        # Remove the 'age' column from the User table
        migrator.drop_column(User, 'age')

        # Rename the column back to 'email'
        migrator.rename_column(User, 'email_address', 'email')
```

In this example, we define a migration with two methods: `up()` and `down()`. The `up()` method adds a new column to the User table and renames the email column. The `down()` method reverses these changes.

To run the migration, execute the following code:

```python
database = SqliteDatabase('mydatabase.db')
migrator = Migrator(database)
migration = Migration001(database)
migration.run()
```

This will apply the migration to the database specified in the migration class.

## Conclusion

Peewee provides a convenient and easy-to-use way to perform 데이터 마이그레이션 when working with databases in Python. With the ability to define and execute migration scripts, you can seamlessly evolve your database schema while preserving existing data.

By following the steps and utilizing the provided examples in this blog post, you should be well-equipped to perform 데이터 마이그레이션 using Peewee in your Python projects.

Happy coding!
