In web scraping, extracting metadata from a web page can provide valuable information about the page's content, authorship, and other relevant details. With the help of the **requests-html** library in Python, we can easily extract metadata from HTML documents.

## Installing requests-html

Before diving into the code, make sure you have the **requests-html** library installed. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install requests-html
```

## Extracting Metadata using requests-html

To extract metadata from an HTML document using **requests-html**, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession
```

2. Create an instance of the `HTMLSession` class:

```python
session = HTMLSession()
```

3. Make a GET request to the desired URL:

```python
url = "https://example.com"  # Replace with the actual URL
response = session.get(url)
```

4. Extract the metadata from the HTML document:

```python
metadata = response.html.xpath('//meta')
```

Here, we use `xpath` to select all `<meta>` elements present in the HTML document.

5. Print or manipulate the extracted metadata:

```python
for meta in metadata:
    print(meta.attrs)
```

By accessing the `attrs` property of each `<meta>` element, we can retrieve the metadata attributes.

6. Close the session to free up resources:

```python
session.close()
```

## Example

Let's put it all together in an example that extracts metadata from the [Google](https://www.google.com) homepage:

```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession

session = HTMLSession()
url = "https://www.google.com"
response = session.get(url)

metadata = response.html.xpath('//meta')

for meta in metadata:
    print(meta.attrs)

session.close()
```

When you run this code, you'll see the metadata attributes printed in the console.

## Conclusion

Using the **requests-html** library, extracting metadata from HTML documents becomes a straightforward task in Python. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily retrieve useful information about web pages and use it for various purposes. Happy scraping!
