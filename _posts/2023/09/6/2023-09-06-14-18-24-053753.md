![wxPython SashWindow](https://www.wxpython.org/images/sashwindow.png)

The **wx.SashWindow** is a powerful feature of the **wxPython** library that allows you to create resizable windows with adjustable sashes, similar to the sash windows commonly found in GUI applications. This sash window allows the user to dynamically adjust the size of different sections within the window by dragging the sashes.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use the **wx.SashWindow** class in wxPython to create resizable windows in Python.

## Getting Started
Before we dive into the code examples, make sure you have **wxPython** installed. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install wxPython
```

## Creating a Basic SashWindow
To get started, let's create a basic wxPython application with a **wx.SashWindow**.

```python
import wx

class MySashWindow(wx.SashWindow):
    def __init__(self, parent):
        wx.SashWindow.__init__(self, parent, id=wx.ID_ANY, style=wx.SW_3D | wx.SASH_BORDER)

        # Add content to the sash window
        self.panel = wx.Panel(self)
        self.panel.SetBackgroundColour(wx.WHITE)

        # Set initial sash position and size
        self.SetSashSize(10)
        self.SetSashVisible(wx.SASH_RIGHT, True)
        self.SetDefaultSize(wx.Size(200, 200))

        # Bind the sash events
        self.Bind(wx.EVT_SASH_DRAGGED_RANGE, self.OnSashDrag)

    def OnSashDrag(self, event):
        # Handle sash drag event here
        pass

class MyFrame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent):
        wx.Frame.__init__(self, parent, title="Resizable Window Example")

        # Create a sash window
        self.sashWindow = MySashWindow(self)

        # Set the sash window as the main window
        self.SetSize(wx.Size(500, 500))
        self.Centre()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = wx.App()
    frame = MyFrame(None)
    frame.Show()
    app.MainLoop()
```

In the above code, we create a new class `MySashWindow`, which inherits from `wx.SashWindow`. We add content to the sash window by creating a panel and setting its background color to white. We then set the initial sash position and size using `SetSashSize` and `SetSashVisible` methods. Finally, we bind the `EVT_SASH_DRAGGED_RANGE` event to a handler function `OnSashDrag`, which will be called when the sash is dragged.

We also create a basic `MyFrame` class that inherits from `wx.Frame` and contains the sash window. We set the size of the frame and center it on the screen.

## Handling Sash Drag Events
To handle sash drag events, we need to implement the `OnSashDrag` method. This method will be called whenever the user drags the sash. You can then update the window layout or perform any other action based on the sash position.

```python
def OnSashDrag(self, event):
    # Get the sash position
    sashPosition = event.GetEdgePosition(wx.SASH_RIGHT)

    # Update the layout based on the sash position
    self.panel.SetSize(wx.Size(sashPosition, self.GetSize().height))

    # Refresh the layout
    self.Layout()
```

In the above example, we get the sash position using `GetEdgePosition` and update the size of the panel based on the sash position. We then call `Layout` to refresh the layout of the sash window.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we explored how to use the **wx.SashWindow** class in **wxPython** to create resizable windows in Python. We learned how to create a basic sash window, handle sash drag events, and update the window layout based on the sash position.

The **wx.SashWindow** provides a flexible and intuitive way to create resizable windows in your wxPython applications, giving your users more control over the application's layout. Experiment with different configurations and layouts to make your applications more user-friendly and customizable.

Happy coding with **wxPython** and **wx.SashWindow**!
