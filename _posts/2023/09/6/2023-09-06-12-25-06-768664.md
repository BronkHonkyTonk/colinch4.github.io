In this blog post, we will explore how to develop a custom middleware for the **requests-html** library in Python. 

## Introduction to requests-html

**requests-html** is a Python library that provides a convenient and powerful way to interact with websites, make HTTP requests, and parse HTML responses. It is built on top of the popular **requests** library and uses the **pyppeteer** library for HTML rendering.

By default, **requests-html** provides a set of middleware that allows modifying requests and responses. However, there may be situations where you need to implement custom functionality for handling requests or responses.

## Setting up the Development Environment

Before we begin, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install **requests-html** using pip:

```python
pip install requests-html
```

We also need to install the **requests** library:

```python
pip install requests
```

## Implementing a Custom Middleware

To implement a custom middleware for **requests-html**, we need to create a class that inherits from the `BaseMiddleware` class provided by the library. This class contains various methods that we can override to customize the behavior of the middleware.

Here's an example of a custom middleware that adds a custom header to each request:

```python
from requests_html import BaseMiddleware

class CustomMiddleware(BaseMiddleware):
    def __init__(self, header):
        super().__init__()
        self.header = header

    async def __call__(self, request):
        request.headers.update(self.header)
        response = await self.next_middleware(request)
        return response
```

In the example above, we define a `CustomMiddleware` class that takes a header dictionary as a parameter. In the `__call__` method, we update the request headers with the custom header and then call the `next_middleware` method to pass the modified request to the next middleware in the chain.

## Using the Custom Middleware

To use our custom middleware, we have to create an instance of it and add it to the **requests-html** session. Here's an example:

```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession

url = "https://example.com"
header = {"User-Agent": "Custom User-Agent"}

session = HTMLSession()
session.mount("https://", CustomMiddleware(header))
response = session.get(url)
```

In the example above, we create an instance of the `HTMLSession` class from **requests-html**. Then, we create an instance of our `CustomMiddleware` class and pass it the custom header. Finally, we mount the middleware to the session by calling the `mount` method.

Now, when we make requests using the session, our custom middleware will add the custom header to each request.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to develop a custom middleware for the **requests-html** library in Python. Custom middlewares allow us to modify requests and responses, enabling us to tailor the behavior of the library to our specific needs.

By implementing a custom middleware, we can extend the functionality of **requests-html** and customize its behavior to suit our use cases.
