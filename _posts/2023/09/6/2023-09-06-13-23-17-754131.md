In this blog post, we will discuss how to set session timeouts in Python using Psycopg2. Psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL adapter for Python that allows easy integration between Python and PostgreSQL databases. By setting session timeouts, you can control the maximum duration of a session before it is automatically terminated.

**Setting up Psycopg2**

Before we start, make sure you have Psycopg2 installed. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install psycopg2
```

**Setting Session Timeouts**

To set session timeouts in Psycopg2, you need to modify the `connect` method that establishes a connection with the PostgreSQL database. The `connect` method accepts various parameters, including `options` that allow you to customize the session settings.

Here's an example of how to set the session timeout to 10 minutes using the `options` parameter:

```python
import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import extensions

# Set session timeout in seconds
timeout = 600

# Create the connection object
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    dbname="your_db", 
    user="your_user", 
    password="your_password", 
    host="your_host", 
    port="your_port",
    options=f'-c statement_timeout={timeout * 1000}'
)

# ... Rest of the code ...
```

In the code above, we use the `options` parameter to set the `statement_timeout` parameter, which determines the session timeout in milliseconds. We multiply the `timeout` value by 1000 to convert it to milliseconds.

**Handling Session Timeouts**

When a session timeout occurs, an exception `psycopg2.errors.AdminShutdown` is raised. You can catch and handle this exception to perform any necessary cleanup or take appropriate actions.

```python
try:
    # Perform database operations
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")
    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    cursor.close()

except psycopg2.errors.AdminShutdown:
    # Handle session timeout
    print("Session timeout occurred")
    # Perform necessary cleanup or actions

finally:
    # Close the connection
    conn.close()
```

In the code snippet above, we wrap the database operations within a try-except block to catch the `psycopg2.errors.AdminShutdown` exception. In the except block, you can handle the session timeout by performing necessary cleanup or other actions.

**Conclusion**

By setting session timeouts in Psycopg2, you can control the duration of a session and ensure that long-running queries or idle connections are automatically terminated. This helps in managing database resources efficiently and improving overall system performance.
