In statistics, Principal Component Regression (PCR) is a technique used for regression analysis when dealing with multicollinearity among predictors. It combines the concepts of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and linear regression to create a more robust regression model.

In this blog post, we will explore how to perform PCR using the `statsmodels` library in Python. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Importing the necessary libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```

In this example, we are importing `numpy` for numerical computations, `pandas` for data manipulation, `statsmodels` for regression analysis, and `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn for data standardization.

## Step 2: Load and preprocess the data

```python
# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Separate the predictors and the target variable
X = data.drop("target_variable", axis=1)
y = data["target_variable"]

# Standardize the predictors
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

Assuming you have your data in a CSV file named "data.csv", we load the data using `pandas` and separate the predictors (`X`) and the target variable (`y`). Then, we apply standardization to the predictors using `StandardScaler`.

## Step 3: Perform Principal Component Regression

```python
# Perform Principal Component Analysis
pca = PCA()
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)

# Select the desired number of principal components
num_components = 5
X_pca_selected = X_pca[:, :num_components]

# Add constant to X_pca_selected
X_pca_selected = sm.add_constant(X_pca_selected)

# Fit the regression model
model = sm.OLS(y, X_pca_selected)
results = model.fit()
```

Now we perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the standardized predictors (`X_scaled`) using `PCA` from scikit-learn. We then select the desired number of principal components (`num_components`) and add a constant column to the selected components. Finally, we fit the Multiple Linear Regression model using `sm.OLS` from `statsmodels` and obtain the results.

## Step 4: Analyze the results

```python
print(results.summary())
```

We can analyze the results using the `summary()` method of the fitted model. It provides detailed information such as R-squared, coefficients, p-values, and more.

## Conclusion

Principal Component Regression is a useful technique to overcome multicollinearity issues in regression analysis. By combining the power of PCA and linear regression, it allows us to build more robust models with improved interpretability.

In this blog post, we demonstrated how to perform Principal Component Regression using the `statsmodels` library in Python. Make sure to experiment with different settings and hyperparameters to optimize your models according to your specific needs.

Happy coding!
