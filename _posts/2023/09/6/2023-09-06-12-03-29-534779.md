Today, we will talk about how to handle WebSocket requests using the `requests-html` library in Python. WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## Installation

First, let's install the `requests-html` library using pip:

```bash
pip install requests-html
```

Next, we need to import the necessary modules in our Python script:

```python
from requests_html import AsyncHTMLSession
import asyncio
```

## Making WebSocket Requests

To make WebSocket requests using `requests-html`, we first need to create an instance of `AsyncHTMLSession`. This class provides an asyncio-compatible interface for making HTML requests, including WebSocket connections.

```python
session = AsyncHTMLSession()
```

Next, we use the `ws_connect()` method to establish a WebSocket connection. 

```python
async def connect_websocket(url):
    ws = await session.ws_connect(url)
    return ws
```

The `ws_connect()` method takes in the WebSocket URL as a parameter and returns a WebSocket object.

## Sending and Receiving Messages

Once we have established a WebSocket connection, we can send and receive messages.

To send a message, we can use the `send_text()` method of the WebSocket object:

```python
async def send_message(ws, message):
    await ws.send_text(message)
```

To receive messages, we can use the `receive_text()` method in a loop:

```python
async def receive_messages(ws):
    async for message in ws:
        print("Received message:", message.text)
```

## Closing the WebSocket Connection

Finally, when we are done with the WebSocket connection, we can close it using the `close()` method:

```python
async def close_connection(ws):
    await ws.close()
```

## Putting It All Together

Let's see an example of how to use these methods to make a WebSocket request:

```python
async def main():
    ws = await connect_websocket("wss://echo.websocket.org")
    await send_message(ws, "Hello, World!")
    await receive_messages(ws)
    await close_connection(ws)

# Run the event loop
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

In this example, we connect to the WebSocket URL `wss://echo.websocket.org`, send the message "Hello, World!", receive any messages sent back from the server, and finally close the WebSocket connection.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to handle WebSocket requests using the `requests-html` library in Python. We covered the basics of establishing a WebSocket connection, sending and receiving messages, and closing the connection. WebSocket provides a powerful mechanism for real-time communication in web applications, and the `requests-html` library makes it easy to work with in Python.

Remember to always refer to the `requests-html` documentation for more advanced usage or specific features that might be available. Happy coding!
