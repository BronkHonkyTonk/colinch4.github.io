Peewee is a lightweight and expressive **Python ORM (Object Relational Mapping)** library that simplifies database operations. It provides a simple and intuitive API to interact with relational databases.

One of the key features of Peewee is its ability to handle **relationships** between database tables. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform relationship queries using Peewee.

## Setup

Before we dive into the details, let's set up a basic database structure to work with. For this example, we will use SQLite as our backend database.

First, we need to install Peewee and SQLite:

```python
pip install peewee
```

Next, let's create a simple database model with two tables - `Author` and `Book`. Each book will have an author associated with it.

```python
from peewee import *

# Create a SQLite database
db = SqliteDatabase('library.db')

# Define Author model
class Author(Model):
    name = CharField()

    class Meta:
        database = db

# Define Book model
class Book(Model):
    title = CharField()
    author = ForeignKeyField(Author, backref='books')

    class Meta:
        database = db

# Create tables
db.create_tables([Author, Book])
```

## Querying Relationships

Now that we have our database set up, let's see how we can query the relationships between our tables using Peewee.

### One-to-Many Relationship

In our example, there is a one-to-many relationship between `Author` and `Book`. An author can have multiple books, and each book is associated with only one author.

To retrieve all the books written by an author, we can use the `Author` model's `books` attribute, which we defined as a `backref` in the `Book` model.

```python
# Query all books written by an author
author = Author.get(Author.id == 1)
books = author.books

for book in books:
    print(book.title)
```

### Many-to-One Relationship

In a many-to-one relationship, multiple records from one table can be associated with a single record in another table. In our example, multiple books can have the same author.

To retrieve the author of a book, we can use the `Book` model's `author` attribute.

```python
# Query the author of a book
book = Book.get(Book.id == 1)
author = book.author

print(author.name)
```

## Conclusion

Peewee makes it simple to perform relationship queries in Python. Whether it's a one-to-many or many-to-one relationship, Peewee provides a clean and intuitive way to work with related tables.

In this blog post, we explored how to perform relationship queries using Peewee. We set up a basic database structure, defined models, and demonstrated how to query relationships between tables.

Peewee is a powerful ORM that offers many more features like many-to-many relationships, filtering, and sorting. If you're working with Python and need to interact with a relational database, Peewee is definitely worth exploring.

Happy coding!
