In this blog post, we will learn how to create a **Socket HTTP 클라이언트** in Python. Using Python's `socket` module, we can establish a connection with a server over the internet and send HTTP requests.

## Setting Up the Environment

Before we begin, ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. You can download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Creating the Socket HTTP Client

To create a Socket HTTP 클라이언트, we will follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules: `socket` and `sys`.
2. Create a TCP/IP socket.
3. Connect to the server using the socket's `connect()` function.
4. Send an HTTP request to the server using the socket's `sendall()` function.
5. Receive the response from the server using the socket's `recv()` function.
6. Print the response.

Here's an example code that demonstrates the steps mentioned above:

```python
import socket
import sys

def send_http_request(host, port, message):
    # Create a TCP/IP socket
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    try:
        # Connect to the server
        client_socket.connect((host, port))

        # Send the HTTP request
        client_socket.sendall(message.encode())

        # Receive the response
        response = client_socket.recv(4096)
        print(response.decode())

    finally:
        # Close the socket
        client_socket.close()

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    host = "www.example.com"
    port = 80
    http_request = "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.example.com\r\n\r\n"

    send_http_request(host, port, http_request)
```

In the example code above, we create a function `send_http_request()` that takes the server's `host`, `port`, and the HTTP `message` as inputs. Inside the function, we follow the steps mentioned earlier to establish a connection with the server, send the HTTP request, receive the response, and print it.

## Testing the Socket HTTP Client

To test the Socket HTTP 클라이언트, replace the `host` variable with the desired server's hostname, the `port` variable with the appropriate port number, and the `http_request` variable with the desired HTTP request. Then, run the Python script.

The script will establish a connection with the server, send the HTTP request, receive the response, and display it on the console.

Now you have successfully created a Socket HTTP 클라이언트 in Python! You can further enhance this client by adding error handling, handling different types of HTTP requests, and parsing the response.

I hope you found this post helpful in understanding how to create a Socket HTTP 클라이언트 in Python. Happy coding!
