When building a web scraping or data extraction application, one common task is extracting image URLs from web pages. In this blog post, we'll explore how to achieve this using the **requests-html** library in Python.

## Installing requests-html

Before we start, let's make sure we have the **requests-html** library installed. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install requests-html
```

Now that we have **requests-html** installed, let's dive into how to extract image URLs from web pages.

## Importing necessary modules

First, let's import the necessary modules from **requests_html**:

```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession
```

## Creating a session

Once we have imported the required modules, we need to create an instance of the `HTMLSession` class. This session object will allow us to send HTTP requests and parse the HTML content of the web page:

```python
session = HTMLSession()
```

## Sending a request and parsing the content

To extract image URLs, we need to send a request to the web page and parse its content using the `HTMLSession.get()` method. Here's an example:

```python
response = session.get("https://example.com")
```

## Extracting image URLs

Now, let's extract the image URLs from the parsed HTML content. We can use the `.find()` method from the **requests-html** library to select all image elements on the page. Here's an example:

```python
image_elements = response.html.find("img")
```

## Iterating over image elements and extracting URLs

Next, we can iterate over the image elements and extract the URLs using the `.attrs['src']` attribute. Here's an example:

```python
image_urls = []
for element in image_elements:
    image_urls.append(element.attrs['src'])
```

## Printing the extracted URLs

Finally, let's print the extracted image URLs:

```python
for url in image_urls:
    print(url)
```

## Full code example

Here's the full code example that puts it all together:

```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession

session = HTMLSession()
response = session.get("https://example.com")

image_elements = response.html.find("img")

image_urls = []
for element in image_elements:
    image_urls.append(element.attrs['src'])

for url in image_urls:
    print(url)
```

And there you have it! You now know how to extract image URLs from web pages using the **requests-html** library in Python.

Happy extracting!
