The `linalg.inv` function in the `numpy` library is used to compute the inverse of a square matrix. This function can be particularly useful in various scientific and engineering applications where matrix operations are required.

### Syntax

The syntax for using the `linalg.inv` function is as follows:

```python
numpy.linalg.inv(a)
```

Where `a` is the input matrix.

### Example

Let's consider a simple example to understand how to use the `linalg.inv` function.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2x2 matrix
a = np.array([[4, 7], [2, 6]])

# Compute the inverse using linalg.inv
inv_a = np.linalg.inv(a)

# Output the inverse matrix
print(inv_a)
```

In this example, we have created a 2x2 matrix `a` using the `np.array` function. We then use the `np.linalg.inv` function to compute the inverse matrix `inv_a`. Finally, we print the inverse matrix.

The output of the above code will be:

```
[[ 0.6 -0.7]
 [-0.2  0.4]]
```

### Handling Exceptions

It is important to note that the `linalg.inv` function raises a `LinAlgError` exception if the input matrix is singular or not square. To handle such exceptions, it is recommended to use a `try-except` block as shown in the following example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2x3 matrix (not square)
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

try:
    inv_a = np.linalg.inv(a)
    print(inv_a)
except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
    print("Input matrix is not invertible.")
```

In this example, as the input matrix `a` is not square, the `LinAlgError` exception is raised. We catch the exception in the `except` block and print a custom error message.

### Conclusion

The `numpy.linalg.inv` function provides a convenient way to compute the inverse of a square matrix in Python. It is a powerful tool in linear algebra and can be used in various numerical computations. Remember to handle exceptions appropriately when working with this function to avoid any unexpected issues.
