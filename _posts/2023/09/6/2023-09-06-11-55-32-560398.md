In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `requests-html` library in Python to capture and screenshot web pages. `requests-html` is a popular library that allows us to easily interact with websites by making HTTP requests and parsing the HTML response.

## Installing requests-html
First, we need to install the `requests-html` library. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```shell
$ pip install requests-html
```

## Basic Usage

To get started, we need to import the necessary modules and initialize an instance of the `HTMLSession` class from `requests-html`. Here's an example:

```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession

# Create an HTML session
session = HTMLSession()
```

Now, we can use the `session` object to send HTTP requests to a website and fetch its HTML content. For example, let's fetch the HTML content of the Python website:

```python
# Send a GET request to the Python website
r = session.get('https://www.python.org')

# Access the HTML content
html_content = r.text

# print the HTML content
print(html_content)
```

## Capturing Screenshots

To capture a screenshot of a web page, the `requests-html` library provides an `html.render()` method. This inbuilt method allows us to render the HTML content of a web page using a headless browser. Here's an example:

```python
# Render the HTML content using a headless browser
r.html.render()

# Capture a screenshot of the rendered page
r.html.render(screenshot='screenshot.png')
```

In the example above, we first render the HTML content using the `render()` method and then capture a screenshot of the rendered page using the `screenshot` argument.

## Improving Rendering Performance

By default, `requests-html` uses a headless browser called **Pyppeteer** to render the web page content. However, Pyppeteer can be slow and resource-intensive, especially when capturing multiple screenshots. To overcome this, we can use an alternative headless browser called **Pyppeteer-puppeteer** which is a lightweight version of Pyppeteer.

To use Pyppeteer-puppeteer, we need to install it first:
```shell
$ pip install pyppeteer-puppeteer
```

Then, we can pass the Pyppeteer-puppeteer browser to the `HTMLSession` object:

```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession
from pyppeteer import launch

# Create an HTML session with Pyppeteer-puppeteer browser
session = HTMLSession(browser_args=['--no-sandbox'], browser=launch())
```

By using Pyppeteer-puppeteer, you should notice improved performance when capturing screenshots.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to use the `requests-html` library in Python to capture and screenshot web pages. We learned how to install the library, make HTTP requests, fetch HTML contents, and capture screenshots using the `render()` method. Additionally, we discussed using the lightweight Pyppeteer-puppeteer browser for better rendering performance.

The `requests-html` library provides a powerful and convenient way to interact with web pages and automate tasks. It can be used for web scraping, screen scraping, and performing various web-related tasks with great ease. Try it out in your next Python project!

Remember to **always respect the terms of service and usage policies of the websites you are accessing** when using web scraping and automation techniques.
