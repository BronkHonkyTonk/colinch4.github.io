SQLAlchemy is a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python that provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for interacting with databases. It allows you to define database tables as Python classes and perform CRUD operations using Python code.

## Installing SQLAlchemy

Before we dive into defining tables and mapping classes, let's make sure SQLAlchemy is installed. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install SQLAlchemy
```

## Defining Tables

To define a table in SQLAlchemy, we use the `Table` class and specify the table name and its columns. Each column is defined with a name, data type, and optional constraints.

Here's an example of defining a simple `users` table with `id`, `name`, and `email` columns:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, Column, Integer, String, MetaData

metadata = MetaData()

users = Table('users', metadata,
    Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column('name', String),
    Column('email', String, unique=True)
)
```

In the above code snippet, we import the necessary classes from SQLAlchemy and create a `MetaData` object. We then define the `users` table with three columns: `id`, `name`, and `email`. The `id` column is the primary key, and the `email` column is marked as unique.

## Mapping Classes

After defining the table, we can map it to a Python class using the `mapper` function provided by SQLAlchemy. This allows us to interact with the table using instances of the mapped class.

Here's an example of mapping the `users` table to a Python class:

```python
from sqlalchemy import mapper

class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

mapper(User, users)
```

In the above code snippet, we define a `User` class with `name` and `email` attributes. We then use the `mapper` function to map the `User` class to the `users` table.

## CRUD Operations

Once the table is defined and mapped to a Python class, we can perform CRUD operations using instances of the mapped class.

### Creating a Record

To create a new record in the table, we first need to create an instance of the mapped class and then add it to a session and commit the changes.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///mydb.sqlite')
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

user = User('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com')
session.add(user)
session.commit()
```

In the above code snippet, we create a SQLite database engine and a session. We then create a new `User` instance, add it to the session, and commit the changes.

### Reading Records

To retrieve records from the table, we can use the session to query the mapped class:

```python
users = session.query(User).all()

for user in users:
    print(user.name, user.email)
```

In the above code snippet, we retrieve all `User` instances from the `users` table and iterate over them to print their names and emails.

### Updating a Record

To update a record, we retrieve it from the table, modify its attributes, and commit the changes:

```python
user = session.query(User).filter_by(name='John Doe').first()
user.email = 'john@example.com'
session.commit()
```

In the above code snippet, we retrieve the `User` instance with the name 'John Doe', update its email, and commit the changes.

### Deleting a Record

To delete a record, we first retrieve it from the table and then delete it from the session:

```python
user = session.query(User).filter_by(name='John Doe').first()
session.delete(user)
session.commit()
```

In the above code snippet, we retrieve the `User` instance with the name 'John Doe', delete it from the session, and commit the changes.

## Conclusion

SQLAlchemy provides a powerful and flexible way to define database tables and map them to Python classes. With SQLAlchemy, you can easily perform CRUD operations using Python code, abstracting away the complexities of SQL queries.
