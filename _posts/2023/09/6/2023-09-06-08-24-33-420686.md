The `numpy.full` function is a powerful tool in the **NumPy** library that creates a new array with a specified shape and fills it with a constant value.

## Syntax

```python
numpy.full(shape, fill_value, dtype=None, order='C')
```

- `shape`: The shape of the output array. This can be a single integer or a sequence of integers.
- `fill_value`: The constant value to fill the array with.
- `dtype` (optional): The data type of the output array. If not specified, it will default to `None` and **NumPy** will automatically determine the data type based on the `fill_value` parameter.
- `order` (optional): Specifies the memory layout of the array. It can be either `'C'` (row-major) or `'F'` (column-major). The default is `'C'`.

## Usage Examples

Let's explore some examples to understand how the `numpy.full` function works.

### Example 1: Creating a 1D Array

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.full(5, 3)
print(a)
```

Output:
```
array([3, 3, 3, 3, 3])
```

In this example, we create a 1-dimensional array of size 5 and fill it with the value 3. The resulting array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` is printed.

### Example 2: Creating a 2D Array

```python
import numpy as np

b = np.full((3, 2), 5, dtype=float)
print(b)
```

Output:
```
array([[5., 5.],
       [5., 5.],
       [5., 5.]])
```

In this example, we create a 2-dimensional array of shape `(3, 2)` and fill it with the value 5. The data type of the array is explicitly set to `float` using the `dtype` parameter. The resulting array is printed.

### Example 3: Creating an Array with a Different Memory Layout

```python
import numpy as np

c = np.full((2, 2), 7, order='F')
print(c)
```

Output:
```
array([[7, 7],
       [7, 7]])
```

In this example, we create a 2-dimensional array of shape `(2, 2)` and fill it with the value 7. The `order` parameter is set to `'F'`, which specifies a column-major memory layout. The resulting array is printed.

## Conclusion

The `numpy.full` function is a versatile tool for creating new arrays with a constant value. It allows you to specify the shape, fill value, data type, and memory layout of the resulting array. Understanding how to use this function will greatly enhance your data manipulation capabilities with the **NumPy** library.
