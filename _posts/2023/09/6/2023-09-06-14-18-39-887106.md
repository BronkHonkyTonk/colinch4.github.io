When building desktop applications using Python, **tkinter** is a popular choice for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). One common feature of many applications is a status bar that provides feedback and information to the user.

In this blog post, we will explore how to add a status bar to a tkinter application in Python, allowing you to display messages or information about the current state of your application.

## Step 1: Import tkinter and create the main window

First, we need to import the `tkinter` module and create the main window for our application. This can be done using the following code:

```python
import tkinter as tk

# Create the main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("My Application")
```

## Step 2: Create the status bar

Next, we will create the status bar widget within our main window. The status bar widget in tkinter is typically implemented using a `Label` or `Entry` widget.

To create a `Label` widget for our status bar, we can use the following code:

```python
# Create a status bar widget
status_bar = tk.Label(root, text="Ready", bd=1, relief=tk.SUNKEN, anchor=tk.W)
status_bar.pack(side=tk.BOTTOM, fill=tk.X)
```

In the above code, we create a `Label` widget called `status_bar` and set the text to "Ready". We also set the `bd` (border) parameter to 1 and the `relief` parameter to `tk.SUNKEN` to give it a sunken appearance. The `anchor` parameter is set to `tk.W` to align the text to the left.

Finally, we use the `pack()` method to add the status bar widget to the bottom of the main window and make it fill the width of the window.

## Step 3: Update the status bar text

To update the text of the status bar dynamically, we can define a function that takes a string as input and updates the `text` attribute of the status bar widget. Here's an example:

```python
def update_status_bar(text):
    status_bar.config(text=text)
```

## Step 4: Test the status bar

To test our status bar implementation, we can create a simple button that changes the status bar text when clicked. Here's an example:

```python
def change_status_bar_text():
    update_status_bar("Button clicked!")

# Create a button
button = tk.Button(root, text="Click me!", command=change_status_bar_text)
button.pack()

# Run the tkinter main loop
root.mainloop()
```

In the above code, we define a function `change_status_bar_text()` that calls `update_status_bar()` with the desired text. We then create a `Button` widget called `button` that triggers the `change_status_bar_text()` function when clicked. Finally, we run the `tkinter` main loop to start the application.

That's it! You have successfully added a status bar to your tkinter application in Python. You can customize the appearance and behavior of the status bar further based on your application's requirements.
