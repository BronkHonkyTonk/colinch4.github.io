If you're developing a Python application and need to integrate web browsing capabilities into it, PyQt provides two options: `QWebView` and `QWebEngineView`.

## QWebView

`QWebView` is a widget that allows you to display web content in your PyQt application. It is based on the WebKit rendering engine and provides a simple way to embed web pages or HTML content.

### Installation

To use `QWebView`, you need to install the PyQt5 library. You can do this by running the following command:

```python
pip install PyQt5
```

### Example usage

Here's a simple example of how to use `QWebView` to display a web page in PyQt:

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QVBoxLayout, QWidget
from PyQt5.QtWebKitWidgets import QWebView

app = QApplication([])
window = QMainWindow()
layout = QVBoxLayout()

webview = QWebView()
webview.load('https://www.example.com')
layout.addWidget(webview)

widget = QWidget()
widget.setLayout(layout)
window.setCentralWidget(widget)

window.show()
app.exec_()
```

In this example, we create a `QWebView` object, load a web page using the `load()` method, and then add the web view widget to a layout. We set this layout as the central widget of a main window and display it using `show()`.

## QWebEngineView

Starting from Qt 5.5, a new web engine called `QWebEngineView` was introduced as a replacement for `QWebView`. It is based on the Chromium web engine and provides improved performance, security, and support for modern web technologies.

### Installation

To use `QWebEngineView`, you need to install the PyQtWebEngine library. You can do this by running the following command:

```python
pip install PyQtWebEngine
```

### Example usage

Here's an example of how to use `QWebEngineView` to display a web page in PyQt:

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QVBoxLayout, QWidget
from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView

app = QApplication([])
window = QMainWindow()
layout = QVBoxLayout()

webview = QWebEngineView()
webview.setUrl('https://www.example.com')
layout.addWidget(webview)

widget = QWidget()
widget.setLayout(layout)
window.setCentralWidget(widget)

window.show()
app.exec_()
```

This example is similar to the previous one, but we use `QWebEngineView` instead of `QWebView`. The `setUrl()` method is used to load a web page.

## Conclusion

Both `QWebView` and `QWebEngineView` provide powerful web browsing capabilities for your PyQt application. `QWebView` is a lightweight option based on the WebKit engine, while `QWebEngineView` is a more advanced solution based on the Chromium engine. Choose the one that best suits your needs based on performance, supported features, and compatibility with your application.
