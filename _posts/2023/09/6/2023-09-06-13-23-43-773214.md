To begin, make sure you have `Psycopg2` installed. If you don't have it already, you can install it using `pip`:

```python
pip install psycopg2
```

Once you have `Psycopg2` installed, let's create a simple server-side function that retrieves data from a PostgreSQL database using PL/Python. Here's an example:

```python
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_details(user_id INTEGER)
RETURNS JSONB
LANGUAGE plpython3u
AS $$
import psycopg2

def get_user_details(user_id):
    conn = psycopg2.connect(
        host="your_host",
        port=5432,
        database="your_database",
        user="your_user",
        password="your_password"
    )

    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")

    user_data = cursor.fetchone()

    cursor.close()
    conn.close()

    # Convert the user data to a dictionary and return as JSON
    return {"id": user_data[0], "name": user_data[1], "email": user_data[2]}

return get_user_details(user_id)
$$;
```

In the above example, we define a server-side function `get_user_details`, which takes a `user_id` as input and returns the user details as JSON. Inside the function, we establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database using `psycopg2.connect`. We then execute a SQL query to fetch the user data and convert it into JSON format before returning it.

To use the `get_user_details` function, you can simply call it in a SQL query like this:

```python
SELECT get_user_details(1);
```

This will return the user details of the user with `id` equal to 1.

Server-side programming with `PL/Python` and `Psycopg2` provides a flexible and powerful way to work with PostgreSQL databases. You can leverage the full power of Python and `Psycopg2` to perform complex data processing, calculations, and more directly within the database engine.

That's it for this blog post! We explored the usage of `Psycopg2` for server-side programming with `PL/Python` in PostgreSQL. Hope you found it helpful and stay tuned for more informative blog posts.
