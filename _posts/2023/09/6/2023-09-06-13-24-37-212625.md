Peewee is a simple yet powerful Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It provides a convenient way to interact with databases by abstracting the underlying database-specific details.

When working with databases, it is common to have default values for columns or enforce constraints on the data being inserted. In this blog post, we will explore how to set default values and constraints in Peewee.

## Setting Default Values

Default values are used to provide a fallback value for a column when no value is explicitly specified during an insert operation. Peewee allows you to set default values for columns using the `default` parameter in the field definition.

Let's say we have a `User` model with a `status` column that defaults to `'active'`:

```python
from peewee import Model, CharField, TextField

class User(Model):
    username = CharField()
    status = CharField(default='active')
    bio = TextField()

    class Meta:
        database = db
```

In the above example, if we insert a new user without specifying the `status` column, it will automatically be set to `'active'`. However, if we explicitly set a value for the `status` column during the insert, the specified value will be used instead.

## Constraints

Constraints are rules applied to the database to ensure the integrity of the data being inserted or updated. Peewee supports various constraints such as `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `CHECK`, and `FOREIGN KEY`.

### NOT NULL Constraint

The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that a column cannot have a `NULL` value. In Peewee, you can specify the `null` parameter in the field definition to enforce the `NOT NULL` constraint:

```python
from peewee import Model, CharField

class User(Model):
    username = CharField(unique=True)
    password = CharField(null=False)

    class Meta:
        database = db
```

In the above example, the `username` column is unique and the `password` column must not be `NULL` during insert or update operations.

### UNIQUE Constraint

The `UNIQUE` constraint ensures that the values in a column are unique. Peewee provides the `unique` parameter to set the `UNIQUE` constraint on a column:

```python
from peewee import Model, CharField

class User(Model):
    email = CharField(unique=True)
    username = CharField(unique=True)

    class Meta:
        database = db
```

In the above example, both the `email` and `username` columns have the `UNIQUE` constraint.

### CHECK Constraint

The `CHECK` constraint allows you to specify a condition that must be true for the data being inserted or updated. Peewee supports the `constraints` parameter to add a `CHECK` constraint:

```python
from peewee import Model, CharField

class User(Model):
    username = CharField()
    age = IntegerField(constraints=[Check('age > 0')])

    class Meta:
        database = db
```

In the above example, the `age` column has a `CHECK` constraint that ensures the age is greater than `0`.

### Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to set default values and constraints in Peewee. Setting default values and constraints are essential for maintaining data integrity and enforcing business rules. With Peewee, you can easily define default values and constraints for your database columns, making it easier to work with data in your applications.
