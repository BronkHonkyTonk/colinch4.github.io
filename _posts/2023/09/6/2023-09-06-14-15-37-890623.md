Web sockets are a powerful communication protocol that allows real-time, bidirectional communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt, provides support for web sockets through the `QWebSocket` class. In this blog post, we will explore how to use PyQt's `QWebSocket` to implement web socket communication in a Python application.

## Installation

Before we get started, make sure you have PyQt installed. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install PyQt5
```

## Setting up a WebSocket Server

To begin, let's set up a simple WebSocket server using PyQt's `QWebSocketServer`. The server will listen for incoming connections and handle incoming and outgoing messages. Here's an example:

```python
from PyQt5.QtCore import QCoreApplication, QObject
from PyQt5.QtNetwork import QHostAddress, QWebSocketServer

class WebSocketServer(QObject):
    def __init__(self, host, port):
        super(WebSocketServer, self).__init__()
        self.server = QWebSocketServer("My WebSocket Server", QWebSocketServer.NonSecureMode, self)
        if not self.server.listen(QHostAddress(host), port):
            print("Failed to start WebSocket server.")
            return
    
        self.server.newConnection.connect(self.handleNewConnection)

    def handleNewConnection(self):
        socket = self.server.nextPendingConnection()
        socket.textMessageReceived.connect(self.handleMessageReceived)
        socket.disconnected.connect(self.handleSocketDisconnected)

    def handleMessageReceived(self, message):
        print("Received message: ", message)

    def handleSocketDisconnected(self):
        socket = self.sender()
        print("Socket disconnected: ", socket.peerAddress().toString())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QCoreApplication([])
    server = WebSocketServer("localhost", 8000)
    app.exec_()
```

In this code, we create a `WebSocketServer` class that inherits from `QObject` and sets up a `QWebSocketServer` to listen for incoming connections. When a new connection is made, we connect the `textMessageReceived` and `disconnected` signals of the socket to their respective slots.

The `handleMessageReceived` slot is called whenever a new message is received from the client, and the `handleSocketDisconnected` slot is called when the client disconnects. In this example, we simply print the received messages and the socket's peer address to the console.

## Connecting to the WebSocket Server

Now that we have our server set up, let's create a client that connects to it and sends messages. We can use PyQt's `QWebSocket` for this purpose. Here's an example:

```python
from PyQt5.QtCore import QCoreApplication, QObject
from PyQt5.QtWebSockets import QWebSocket

class WebSocketClient(QObject):
    def __init__(self, url):
        super(WebSocketClient, self).__init__()
        self.socket = QWebSocket()
        self.socket.connected.connect(self.handleConnected)
        self.socket.textMessageReceived.connect(self.handleMessageReceived)
        self.socket.disconnected.connect(self.handleDisconnected)

        self.socket.open(QUrl(url))    

    def handleConnected(self):
        print("Connected to server.")

    def handleMessageReceived(self, message):
        print("Received message: ", message)

    def handleDisconnected(self):
        print("Disconnected from server.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QCoreApplication([])
    client = WebSocketClient("ws://localhost:8000")
    app.exec_()
```

In this code, we create a `WebSocketClient` class that inherits from `QObject` and sets up a `QWebSocket`. We connect the `connected`, `textMessageReceived`, and `disconnected` signals of the socket to their respective slots.

The `handleConnected` slot is called when the client successfully connects to the server, the `handleMessageReceived` slot is called when a new message is received, and the `handleDisconnected` slot is called when the client disconnects.

In this example, we simply print the connection state and the received messages to the console.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to use PyQt's `QWebSocket` to implement web socket communication in a Python application. We saw how to set up a WebSocket server that listens for incoming connections and handles incoming and outgoing messages, as well as how to create a client that connects to the server and sends messages.

Web socket communication can be a powerful tool for real-time, bidirectional communication in your Python applications. PyQt's `QWebSocket` provides a convenient way to implement web socket functionality.
