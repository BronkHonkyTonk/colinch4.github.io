In network programming, **sockets** play a vital role in establishing communication between different systems. Once the communication is complete or is no longer needed, it is important to properly **close** the socket to release any resources it may be using.

In Python, socket objects have a `close()` method that allows you to close the socket and free up any associated system resources. Let's take a look at how to use this method.

```python
import socket

# Create a socket
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect to a server
server_address = ('localhost', 12345)
sock.connect(server_address)

# Perform communication tasks...

# Close the socket
sock.close()
```

In the above example, we first import the `socket` module and then create a socket using the `socket.socket()` constructor. We specify the address family as `socket.AF_INET` and the socket type as `socket.SOCK_STREAM` for a TCP socket.

Once the socket is created, we connect to a server using the socket's `connect()` method. This establishes a connection to the specified server address.

After performing the necessary communication tasks, we close the socket using the `close()` method. This ensures that the socket is properly closed and any associated system resources are released.

If you no longer need to use the socket throughout your program, it is good practice to close it as soon as possible to free up system resources and prevent any potential resource leaks.

It is worth noting that if you attempt to perform any operations on a closed socket, it will raise a `socket.error` exception. So, ensure that you don't accidentally use the socket after closing it.

Closing sockets properly is a crucial aspect of network programming to ensure the efficient use of system resources and maintain the stability of your applications. So, always remember to close your sockets when they are no longer needed.

Happy coding!
