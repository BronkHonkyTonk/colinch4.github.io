To use the `wx.MessageBox` function, you need to import the `wx` module in your Python script. Here's an example to show you how to use `wx.MessageBox`:

```python
import wx

# Create a message box with a message and a title
wx.MessageBox("This is a message", "Message Box")

# Create a message box with a message, a title, and an OK button style
wx.MessageBox("This is an info message", "Information", wx.OK | wx.ICON_INFORMATION)

# Create a message box with a message, a title, and yes/no buttons style
response = wx.MessageBox("Are you sure you want to proceed?", "Confirmation", wx.YES_NO | wx.ICON_QUESTION)

# Check the user's response
if response == wx.YES:
    print("User clicked Yes!")
else:
    print("User clicked No!")
```

In the first example, we create a simple message box with a message "This is a message" and a title "Message Box". By default, it displays an OK button for the user to acknowledge and close the message box.

In the second example, we add a style parameter to the `wx.MessageBox` function. In this case, the message box displays an info message with an icon, and it has an OK button as well. The `wx.OK | wx.ICON_INFORMATION` flags are used to set the style.

In the third example, we create a confirmation message box with yes/no buttons and a question mark icon. The user's response is stored in the `response` variable, which can be used to determine the action based on the user's choice.

Overall, the `wx.MessageBox` function provides a convenient way to display message boxes and interact with the user in wxPython applications. It is a powerful tool for communicating important information and gathering user input.
