Data scraping is a common task in the field of data analysis and web development. It involves extracting data from websites and web pages in order to collect and analyze large datasets. Beautiful Soup is a powerful Python library that makes web scraping easy and efficient.

In this blog post, we will explore the basics of using Beautiful Soup 4 for scraping large datasets. We will cover the installation process, basic usage, and a simple example to get you started with scraping.

## Installation

Before we can start using Beautiful Soup, we need to install it. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```python
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

If you do not have pip installed, you can install it using the following command:

```python
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

## Basic Usage

Here is a simple example that demonstrates the basic usage of Beautiful Soup 4. Consider the following HTML code of a web page:

```html
<html>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>This is some paragraph text.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

We can use Beautiful Soup to parse this HTML and extract the required data. Here's how it can be done using Python:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Create a BeautifulSoup object by passing the HTML data
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_data, 'html.parser')

# Extract the text of the <h1> tag
title = soup.find('h1').text

# Extract all the <li> tags and store them in a list
items = [li.text for li in soup.find_all('li')]

# Print the results
print("Title:", title)
print("Items:", items)
```
