Psycopg2 is a popular PostgreSQL adapter for Python, allowing us to interact with PostgreSQL databases in our Python applications. In addition to executing queries and retrieving results, Psycopg2 also provides a way to check and handle the status messages sent by the PostgreSQL server.

Status messages can provide useful information about the execution of SQL statements, such as whether the query was successful or encountered an error. These messages can be particularly helpful when debugging or monitoring the behavior of our application.

In this blog post, we will explore how to check and handle status messages in Psycopg2. We will cover the following topics:

1. Enabling Status Messages in Psycopg2
2. Retrieving Status Messages
3. Handling Error Messages

## 1. Enabling Status Messages in Psycopg2

By default, Psycopg2 does not provide status messages. However, we can enable them by setting the `connection.autocommit` attribute to `True` before executing any SQL statements:

```python
import psycopg2

# Create a connection to the PostgreSQL database
conn = psycopg2.connect(database="mydb", user="myuser", password="mypassword", host="localhost", port="5432")

# Enable status messages
conn.autocommit = True
```

Setting `conn.autocommit` to `True` enables the PostgreSQL server to send status messages to the client.

## 2. Retrieving Status Messages

Once we have enabled status messages, we can retrieve them using the `statusmessage` attribute of the Psycopg2 `cursor` object. The `statusmessage` attribute returns the last status message received from the server.

```python
# Create a cursor
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute a SQL statement
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO mytable (name, age) VALUES ('John Doe', 25)")

# Retrieve and print the status message
print(cursor.statusmessage)
```

In the above example, we execute an `INSERT` statement and retrieve the status message using `cursor.statusmessage`.

## 3. Handling Error Messages

Status messages are not always successful. If an error occurs during the execution of a SQL statement, an error message will be sent by the PostgreSQL server. Psycopg2 provides an exception called `psycopg2.Error` that we can catch to handle error messages:

```python
try:
    # Execute a SQL statement with an error
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM non_existing_table")
except psycopg2.Error as e:
    # Retrieve and print the error message
    print(e)
```

In the example above, we attempt to execute a `SELECT` statement on a non-existing table. If an error occurs, the `psycopg2.Error` exception is raised, and we can retrieve the error message using `print(e)`.

Handling error messages enables us to gracefully handle exceptional situations and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to check and handle status messages in Psycopg2. Enabling status messages allows us to monitor the execution of SQL statements and handle errors effectively. By utilizing these features, we can enhance our debugging and error handling capabilities when working with PostgreSQL databases in Python applications.
