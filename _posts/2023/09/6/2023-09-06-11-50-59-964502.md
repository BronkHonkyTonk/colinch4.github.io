In web development, AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows web pages to make **asynchronous** requests to the server, enabling the dynamic loading and updating of content without page reloading. When it comes to handling AJAX requests in Python, there are various libraries available. One such library is `requests-html`, a powerful library that utilizes the requests library to make HTTP requests and parse HTML content.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use `requests-html` to handle AJAX requests in Python, allowing you to easily retrieve dynamic data from web pages.

## Installation

First, let's install the `requests-html` library using pip:

```python
pip install requests-html
```

## Making AJAX Requests

To make AJAX requests using `requests-html`, you will need to create an instance of the `HTMLSession` class. This class provides methods for making HTTP requests and parsing the returned HTML content.

Here's an example of how to create an `HTMLSession` object and make a GET request to a website:

```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession

session = HTMLSession()
response = session.get('https://example.com')
```

## Handling Dynamic Content

When dealing with AJAX-based web applications, a significant portion of the web page's content is dynamically loaded after the initial page load. It means that the content is not present in the initial HTML response but loaded dynamically using JavaScript.

To handle such scenarios, `requests-html` provides a method called `render()` that will **execute JavaScript** on the page and retrieve the complete rendered content.

Here's an example of how to use the `render()` method to handle dynamic content:

```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession

session = HTMLSession()
response = session.get('https://example.com')
response.html.render()
```

## Extracting Data

Once the dynamic content is rendered, you can use `requests-html`'s built-in methods to extract data from the rendered HTML. For example, you can use CSS selectors or XPath expressions to locate and extract specific elements.

Here's an example of how to extract data using CSS selectors:

```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession

session = HTMLSession()
response = session.get('https://example.com')
response.html.render()

# Extract all text from <h1> tags using CSS selector
titles = response.html.find('h1')
for title in titles:
    print(title.text)
```

## Conclusion

Using the `requests-html` library, you can handle AJAX requests and retrieve dynamic content from web pages in Python effortlessly. It allows you to scrape data from websites that heavily rely on AJAX for content rendering. With the ability to execute JavaScript and utilize CSS selectors or XPath expressions, `requests-html` provides a convenient way to interact with AJAX-based web applications programmatically.
