Isolation levels are an important aspect of database transactions. They determine how changes made by one transaction are visible to other transactions. In **Psycopg2**, a popular PostgreSQL adapter for Python, you can easily set the **isolation level** for your transactions.

In this blog post, we will explore how to configure isolation levels using **Psycopg2** in Python.

## Setting Isolation Levels
To set the isolation level in Psycopg2, you need to establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database and then **set the isolation level** using the `set_isolation_level()` method. This method is available on the connection object.

Here's an example:

```python
import psycopg2

# Establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database
conn = psycopg2.connect(database="my_database", user="my_user", password="my_password", host="localhost", port="5432")

# Set the isolation level to "SERIALIZABLE"
conn.set_isolation_level(psycopg2.extensions.ISOLATION_LEVEL_SERIALIZABLE)

# Perform database operations

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

In the above example, we first establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database using the `psycopg2.connect()` method. We then set the isolation level to `"SERIALIZABLE"` using `conn.set_isolation_level()`.

You can set the isolation level to different options based on your requirements. Some of the common isolation levels include:

- `ISOLATION_LEVEL_AUTOCOMMIT`: This level specifies that each SQL statement is automatically committed and there are no transactions.

- `ISOLATION_LEVEL_READ_UNCOMMITTED`: This level allows transactions to read uncommitted changes made by other transactions.

- `ISOLATION_LEVEL_READ_COMMITTED`: This level ensures that transactions can only read changes that have been committed by other transactions.

- `ISOLATION_LEVEL_REPEATABLE_READ`: This level ensures that transactions see a consistent snapshot of the database even if other transactions are making changes.

- `ISOLATION_LEVEL_SERIALIZABLE`: This level provides the highest level of isolation, ensuring that transactions appear to be executed serially.

After setting the isolation level, you can perform your desired database operations. Once done, it is important to properly close the connection using `conn.close()` to free up system resources.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we have learned how to set isolation levels using **Psycopg2** in Python. Understanding and configuring isolation levels correctly is crucial for maintaining the consistency and integrity of your database transactions. By utilizing the capabilities of **Psycopg2**, you can easily define the desired isolation level for your specific use case.
