Peewee is a lightweight and expressive **ORM** (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for Python. It provides a simple and intuitive API to interact with databases. One of the powerful features of Peewee is the ability to create custom query classes.

Custom query classes allow you to define reusable query operations by subclassing the `peewee.Query` class. This gives you the flexibility to encapsulate complex queries and perform common operations in an organized and modular way.

Let's explore how to create and use custom query classes in Peewee:

## Creating a Custom Query Class

To create a custom query class in Peewee, subclass the `peewee.Query` class and define the desired query methods. These methods can encapsulate complex queries, filters, joins, or any other database operations you need.

```python
from peewee import Query

class CustomQuery(Query):
    def active_users(self):
        return self.where(User.is_active == True)

    def top_sellers(self):
        return self.select(User, fn.Count(Order.id)).join(Order). \
                    group_by(User).order_by(fn.Count(Order.id).desc())
```

In the above example, we have created a `CustomQuery` class that extends the `Query` class. It defines two query methods: `active_users()` and `top_sellers()`.

## Using a Custom Query Class

To use the custom query class in your code, you can invoke its query methods on a Peewee model or an existing query instance. The custom query methods can be chained with other query operations to further modify the query.

```python
users = User.custom_query().active_users().order_by(User.username)
```

In the above example, we invoke the `active_users()` method on a custom query instance obtained from the `User` model. We then chain it with the `order_by()` method to sort the results by the `username` column.

## Benefits of Using Custom Query Classes

Using custom query classes provides several benefits:

1. **Reusability**: Custom query classes allow you to encapsulate complex queries and reuse them across different parts of your codebase. This promotes code organization and makes it easier to maintain and modify queries.

2. **Modularity**: By creating separate query methods for different operations, you can break down complex queries into smaller, manageable chunks. This promotes code readability and reduces duplication.

3. **Abstraction**: Custom query classes can abstract away low-level query details by providing higher-level query methods. This makes the code more concise and easier to understand.

4. **Encapsulation**: Custom query classes allow you to encapsulate database logic within the class itself, making the usage code cleaner and more focused on the specific query requirements.

## Conclusion

Custom query classes in Peewee are a powerful tool for encapsulating and reusing complex query logic. They enhance code organization, modularity, and abstraction. By leveraging custom query classes, you can write cleaner, more maintainable code when working with databases in Python.
