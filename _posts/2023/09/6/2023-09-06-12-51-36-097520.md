Peewee is a **lightweight** and **simple** Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It provides a convenient way to interact with databases and perform various operations. In this blog post, we will explore some of the commonly used functions of the Peewee library.

## Connecting to a Database

The first step in using Peewee is establishing a connection to the database. Here's an example of how to connect to a SQLite database:

```python
import peewee

database = peewee.SqliteDatabase('database.db')

# Create the base model
class BaseModel(peewee.Model):
    class Meta:
        database = database

# Connect to the database
database.connect()
```

Replace `'database.db'` with the path to your SQLite database file, or use a different database engine if desired.

## Creating Models

Peewee models represent database tables and define fields and relationships. Let's create a simple `User` model:

```python
class User(BaseModel):
    username = peewee.CharField(unique=True)
    email = peewee.CharField()
    age = peewee.IntegerField()
```

In this example, we defined three fields: `username`, `email`, and `age`. The `unique=True` attribute ensures that the `username` field is unique for each user.

## Creating and Saving Records

To create a new record in the database, we can simply create an instance of the model and call the `save()` method:

```python
user = User(username='john_doe', email='john@example.com', age=25)
user.save()
```

Peewee automatically generates SQL statements and executes them to insert the new record into the database.

## Querying Records

Peewee provides a rich set of functions for querying records in the database. Here are a few examples:

### Get all records

To retrieve all records from a table, we can use the `select()` function:

```python
users = User.select()
for user in users:
    print(user.username, user.email, user.age)
```

### Filter records

To filter records based on certain conditions, we can use the `where()` function:

```python
users = User.select().where(User.age >= 18)  # Get users above 18 years old
for user in users:
    print(user.username, user.email, user.age)
```

### Order records

To order records by a specific field, we can use the `order_by()` function:

```python
users = User.select().order_by(User.username)
for user in users:
    print(user.username, user.email, user.age)
```

## Updating Records

To update records in the database, we can use the `update()` method. Here's an example:

```python
user = User.get(User.username == 'john_doe')
user.email = 'john.doe@example.com'
user.save()
```

The `get()` method retrieves a single record that matches the specified condition, and we can then update the record and save it.

## Deleting Records

To delete records from the database, we can use the `delete_instance()` method. Here's an example:

```python
user = User.get(User.username == 'john_doe')
user.delete_instance()
```

This will delete the specified user record from the database.

## Conclusion

Peewee is a powerful and user-friendly library for working with databases in Python. It provides a wide range of functions for creating, querying, updating, and deleting records. By utilizing these functions, you can streamline your database operations and build robust applications.
