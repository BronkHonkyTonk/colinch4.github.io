In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a **socket DNS resolver** using Python. A DNS resolver is a program that converts domain names into IP addresses. We will be using the `socket` library in Python to send DNS queries and receive responses.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running the following command in your terminal:

```python
python --version
```

## Getting Started

Let's begin by importing the necessary modules:

```python
import socket
```

Next, we'll define a function called `resolve_dns` that takes a domain name as input and returns the corresponding IP address. Inside the function, we'll create a **UDP socket** and send a DNS query to the DNS server. We'll then listen for the response and extract the IP address from it.

```python
def resolve_dns(domain):
    # Create a UDP socket
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    
    # DNS server address and port
    dns_server = ('8.8.8.8', 53)
    
    # DNS query
    query = bytes.fromhex('AA AA 01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00') + bytearray(domain.encode()) + bytes.fromhex('00 00 01 00 01')
    
    # Send DNS query to the server
    sock.sendto(query, dns_server)
    
    # Receive DNS response from the server
    response, addr = sock.recvfrom(1024)
    
    # Extract IP address from the response
    ip_address = '.'.join([str(byte) for byte in response[-4:]])
    
    return ip_address
```

## Usage

To use the `resolve_dns` function, simply call it with a domain name as follows:

```python
domain = 'example.com'
ip_address = resolve_dns(domain)
print(f"The IP address of {domain} is {ip_address}")
```

Replace `'example.com'` with the domain name you want to resolve.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've built a simple socket DNS resolver in Python. We used the `socket` library to create a UDP socket and send a DNS query to a DNS server. We then received the response and extracted the IP address from it. This is just a basic implementation, but it can be expanded and customized to suit specific needs.

Feel free to explore further and enhance the DNS resolver by adding error handling, caching, or supporting other DNS query types. Happy resolving!
