In today's blog post, we will explore how to connect and interact with a database using the `requests-html` library in Python. `Requests-html` is a powerful Python library that allows you to easily scrape websites and extract data. However, in this article, we will focus on leveraging its capabilities to connect and interact with databases.

### **Why Connect `requests-html` with a Database?**

`Requests-html` is mainly used for web scraping, but it can also be utilized to retrieve data from a database. By connecting `requests-html` with a database, you can automate the process of extracting data from the web and directly storing it in a database, saving you time and effort.

### **Prerequisites**

Before we get started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Python installed on your machine
- `requests-html` library installed (use `pip install requests-html` to install it)

### **Connecting to a Database**

To connect `requests-html` with a database, you will need to install an appropriate database driver for your specific database. For example, if you are using MySQL, you will need to install the `mysql-connector-python` driver.

Once you have the necessary driver installed, you can establish a connection to the database using the following code snippet:

```python
import requests_html
import mysql.connector

# Establish a connection to the database
database = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    database="your_database"
)

# Create a cursor object to interact with the database
cursor = database.cursor()
```

Make sure to replace `"your_username"`, `"your_password"`, and `"your_database"` with your actual database credentials.

### **Executing Database Queries with `requests-html`**

Now that we have established a database connection, we can execute queries to retrieve or manipulate data. Let's take a look at an example of executing a query to retrieve data from a table:

```python
# Execute a select query
query = "SELECT * FROM table_name"
cursor.execute(query)

# Get all rows from the result set
result = cursor.fetchall()

# Loop through each row and extract data
for row in result:
    # Do something with the data
    print(row)
```

Replace `"table_name"` with the name of the table you want to retrieve data from.

### **Storing Web Data in a Database**

Now, let's see an example of how we can scrape data from a website using `requests-html` and store it directly into a database:

```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession

# Create an HTML session
session = HTMLSession()

# Fetch the webpage
response = session.get("https://example.com")

# Extract relevant information from the webpage using CSS selectors
title = response.html.find("h1", first=True).text
description = response.html.find("p", first=True).text

# Insert the extracted data into the database
query = "INSERT INTO table_name (title, description) VALUES (%s, %s)"
values = (title, description)
cursor.execute(query, values)

# Commit the changes to the database
database.commit()
```

Replace `"https://example.com"` with the URL of the website from which you want to scrape data. Also, adjust the table and column names in the `INSERT INTO` query based on your database schema.

### **Conclusion**

In this article, we learned how to connect `requests-html` with a database in Python. We saw how to establish a connection, execute queries, and store web data directly into a database using `requests-html`'s web scraping capabilities. By leveraging this integration, you can automate the process of extracting and storing data from the web, making your data management tasks more efficient.
