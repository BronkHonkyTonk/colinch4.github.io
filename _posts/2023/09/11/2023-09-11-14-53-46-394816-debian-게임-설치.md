Debian is a popular Linux distribution known for its stability and wide range of software packages. If you're a gamer using Debian and want to install games on your system, this guide will walk you through the process using Bash.

## 1. Enable the non-free repository

First, you need to enable the non-free repository in Debian. This repository contains proprietary software, including some games. Open a terminal and run the following command to edit the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

In the file, uncomment the line that includes "contrib" and "non-free". It should look like this:

```bash
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ buster main contrib non-free
```

## 2. Update the package lists

Next, update the package lists by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

## 3. Install games

Now that the non-free repository is enabled and the package lists are updated, you can install games using the `apt` package manager. Here are a few examples:

- **Doom**: A classic first-person shooter.

```bash
sudo apt install prboom-plus
```

- **SuperTuxKart**: A fun kart racing game.

```bash
sudo apt install supertuxkart
```

- **0 A.D.**: A real-time strategy game.

```bash
sudo apt install 0ad
```

- **OpenTTD**: A transport simulation game.

```bash
sudo apt install openttd
```

Feel free to explore the Debian repositories or do a quick search using the `apt search` command to find more games. Remember to prefix the package name with `sudo apt install` to install the game.

## 4. Launch the games

Once the games are installed, you can launch them either from the application menu or by running the respective command in the terminal. Enjoy gaming on your Debian system!

## Conclusion

With the non-free repository enabled in Debian, you can easily install a variety of games using the `apt` package manager. Whether you're a casual gamer or a dedicated enthusiast, Debian offers a great platform for gaming. Enjoy exploring and playing games on your Debian system!
