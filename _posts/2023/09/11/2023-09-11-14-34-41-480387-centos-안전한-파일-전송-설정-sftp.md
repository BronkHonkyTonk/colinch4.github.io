SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is a secure alternative to FTP for transmitting files between a client and a server. It provides encrypted communication and ensures data integrity. In this blog post, we will guide you on how to configure secure file transfer using SFTP on CentOS.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the setup, make sure you have the following:
- A CentOS server with root access.
- OpenSSH installed on the server.

## Step 1: Enable and configure SSH service
SFTP relies on the SSH service for secure file transfer. By default, SSH is installed and running on CentOS, but it is recommended to verify that it is enabled and properly configured.

1. Connect to your CentOS server via SSH:
```bash
ssh root@your_server_ip
```

2. Open the SSH configuration file using a text editor:
```bash
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

3. Make sure the following lines are uncommented and have the specified values:
```bash
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
Subsystem sftp /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server
```

The first line disables root login, **`PermitRootLogin no`**, which is a security best practice. The second line disables password-based authentication, **`PasswordAuthentication no`**, and enforces key-based authentication for better security. The third line specifies the location of the SFTP subsystem.

4. Save the changes and exit the text editor.

5. Restart the SSH service to apply the changes:
```bash
systemctl restart sshd
```

## Step 2: Create SFTP-only user
To enhance security, it is recommended to create a separate user account dedicated to SFTP access.

1. Create a new user using the **`adduser`** command. Replace `<username>` with your desired username:
```bash
adduser <username>
```

2. Set a password for the user when prompted.

3. Use the **`usermod`** command to restrict the user's access to SFTP only:
```bash
usermod -s /sbin/nologin <username>
```

This command changes the user's shell to `/sbin/nologin`, which restricts direct shell access.

## Step 3: Configure SFTP-specific settings
Finally, we need to configure the specific settings for SFTP.

1. Open the SSH configuration file again:
```bash
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:
```bash
Match User <username>
    ChrootDirectory /srv/sftp/%u
    ForceCommand internal-sftp
    X11Forwarding no
    AllowTcpForwarding no
```

Replace `<username>` with the SFTP user's username.

3. Create the directory that will act as the root directory for the SFTP user:
```bash
mkdir -p /srv/sftp/<username>
```

4. Set the appropriate ownership and permissions on the directory:
```bash
chown root:root /srv/sftp/<username>
chmod 755 /srv/sftp/<username>
```

5. Restart the SSH service to apply the changes:
```bash
systemctl restart sshd
```

## Conclusion
With the steps provided above, you can easily configure secure file transfer using SFTP on CentOS. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of your files during the transfer process. Remember to regularly update your server and apply security patches to stay protected against potential vulnerabilities.
