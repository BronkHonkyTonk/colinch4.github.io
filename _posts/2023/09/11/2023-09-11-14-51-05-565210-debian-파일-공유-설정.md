Sharing files on a Debian system can be quite useful, especially in scenarios where multiple users need access to the same set of files or when transferring files between different systems. In this blog post, we will explore how to share files on a Debian system using Bash commands.

## Configure Samba

Samba is a popular open-source software suite that provides file and print services for Linux and Windows clients. To enable file sharing on Debian, we will start by installing and configuring Samba.

1. Install Samba by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install samba
```

2. Once the installation is complete, open the Samba configuration file using a text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

3. In the configuration file, locate the `[global]` section and add the following lines:
```bash
workgroup = WORKGROUP
server string = %h server (Samba, Debian)
```

Replace `WORKGROUP` with the appropriate workgroup name for your network.

4. Scroll down to the end of the file and add the following configuration for each directory you want to share:

```bash
[shared_directory]
   comment = Shared Directory
   path = /path/to/directory
   browseable = yes
   read only = no
   guest ok = yes
   create mask = 0755
   directory mask = 0755
```

Replace `shared_directory` with the desired name for the share and `/path/to/directory` with the actual path to the directory you want to share.

5. Save the file (`Ctrl + O`) and exit the text editor (`Ctrl + X`).

6. Restart the Samba service for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd
```

## Configure NFS

NFS (Network File System) is another popular file-sharing protocol used in Linux environments. To configure NFS on Debian, follow these steps:

1. Install the NFS server package by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
```

2. Open the exports file using a text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/exports
```

3. In the file, add the following line for each directory you want to share:

```bash
/path/to/directory client_ip(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path to the directory you want to share and `client_ip` with the IP address or hostname of the client system allowed to access the share.

4. Save the file and exit the text editor.

5. Restart the NFS server for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have covered the steps required to set up file sharing on a Debian system using both Samba and NFS protocols. By following these instructions, you can easily share files with other users or systems on your network.

Remember to secure your shares by adjusting the permissions and user access to prevent unauthorized access.
