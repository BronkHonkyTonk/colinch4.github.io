CentOS Linux is a popular operating system commonly used for web servers. As with any system connected to the internet, it is crucial to regularly check for vulnerabilities in order to ensure the security of your web applications and data. One effective way to accomplish this is by utilizing a web vulnerability scanning tool.

In this blog post, we will explore how to perform web vulnerability scanning on CentOS using a Bash script. The script will automate the process of scanning for common vulnerabilities and provide insights into potential security risks.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure your CentOS system meets the following prerequisites:
- CentOS Linux installed and up to date.
- Bash shell is installed (which is usually the default shell in CentOS).

## Setting up the Bash script
1. Open a text editor and create a new file named `web_vulnerability_scanner.sh`.
2. Begin the script by adding the shebang line at the top:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
3. Import any necessary libraries or dependencies for the vulnerability scanner. For example, you might need to install `nmap` or `curl` if they are not already available on your system.
4. Define the main function of the script which will contain the scanning logic:
```bash
main() {
   # Add your scanning logic here
}
```
5. Within the `main` function, start by specifying the target web server or website to scan:
```bash
target="http://example.com"
```
6. Use various Bash commands and tools to perform the vulnerability scanning. For example, you could use `curl` to send HTTP requests and analyze the responses:
```bash
response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $target)
if [[ $response == 200 ]]; then
   echo "The website is accessible."
else
   echo "The website is not accessible. HTTP response code: $response"
fi
```
7. Implement additional scanning techniques as per your requirements. You can use tools like `nmap`, `sqlmap`, or any other tool that suits your needs.

## Running the vulnerability scanner
1. Save and close the script file.
2. Make the script executable by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
chmod +x web_vulnerability_scanner.sh
```
3. Execute the script with the following command:
```bash
./web_vulnerability_scanner.sh
```
4. The script will initiate the vulnerability scanning process and provide feedback on the identified vulnerabilities or potential security risks.

## Conclusion
By creating a simple Bash script, you can automate the process of web vulnerability scanning on your CentOS system. Regularly running this script can help you proactively identify and address potential security risks, enhancing the overall security and reliability of your web applications. Remember to keep the script up to date with the latest security practices and tools for effective scanning.
