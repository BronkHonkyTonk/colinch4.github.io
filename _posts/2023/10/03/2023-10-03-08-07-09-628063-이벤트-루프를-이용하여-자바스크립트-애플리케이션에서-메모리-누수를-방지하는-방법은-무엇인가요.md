Memory leaks can occur in JavaScript applications when objects are not properly garbage collected, leading to a buildup of unused memory over time. One common cause of memory leaks is when event listeners are not removed correctly. 

To prevent memory leaks in JavaScript applications, you can follow these steps:

1. **Manage Event Listeners**: Ensure that event listeners are properly added and removed. When adding an event listener, always use a named function instead of an anonymous function. This allows you to easily reference and remove the listener later.

   ```javascript
   function handleButtonClick() {
     // Handle button click event
   }

   // Add event listener
   document.addEventListener('click', handleButtonClick);

   // Remove event listener
   document.removeEventListener('click', handleButtonClick);
   ```

2. **Avoid Global Variables**: Global variables can prevent objects from being garbage collected, as they maintain references to those objects. Instead, encapsulate your code in modules or functions to limit the scope of variables.

   ```javascript
   (function() {
     var myObject = {};

     // Use myObject
   })();
   ```

3. **Dispose of [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) Elements**: Elements created dynamically or manipulated through JavaScript should be properly removed from the DOM when they are no longer needed or when the associated parent element is removed.

   ```javascript
   var parentElement = document.getElementById('parent');

   // Create dynamic element
   var childElement = document.createElement('div');
   parentElement.appendChild(childElement);

   // Remove element
   parentElement.removeChild(childElement);
   ```

4. **Use `setTimeout` and `setInterval` with caution**: Avoid using `setTimeout` and `setInterval` unnecessarily, as they can keep objects in memory even after they are no longer needed. Make sure to clear timers when they are no longer required.

   ```javascript
   var timeoutId = setTimeout(function() {
     // Do something
   }, 1000);

   // Clear timeout
   clearTimeout(timeoutId);
   ```

By following these best practices, you can minimize the risk of memory leaks in your JavaScript applications and ensure efficient usage of memory resources.
