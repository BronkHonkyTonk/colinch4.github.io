In many programming scenarios, we often encounter situations where we need to perform tasks that have a delayed execution. One common approach to handle such scenarios is by using an event loop. In this blog post, we'll explore an example of how to process delayed tasks using an event loop.

## What is an Event Loop?

An event loop is a programming construct that enables asynchronous and non-blocking execution of tasks. It allows us to schedule tasks to be executed at a later time or after a certain delay. The event loop continuously checks for pending tasks and executes them when their time arrives.

## Example Code

Let's take a look at a simple example in JavaScript that demonstrates how to use an event loop to process delayed tasks:

```javascript
// Define a function to be executed after a specified delay
function delayedTask(delay) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Delayed task executed");
    }, delay);
}

// Schedule delayed tasks
delayedTask(2000); // Execute after 2 seconds
delayedTask(4000); // Execute after 4 seconds
delayedTask(6000); // Execute after 6 seconds
```

In the above code, we define a `delayedTask` function that will be executed after a specified delay using the `setTimeout` function. We then schedule three delayed tasks with different delays using the `delayedTask` function.

When the specified delay for each task elapses, the event loop executes the corresponding task. In this example, the tasks will be executed after 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 6 seconds, respectively.

## Conclusion

Using an event loop is a powerful technique to handle delayed tasks in a program. It allows us to schedule and process tasks asynchronously, without blocking the main execution thread. By leveraging an event loop, we can efficiently manage and execute tasks with delays in our applications.
