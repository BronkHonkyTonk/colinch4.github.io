Memory leaks can be a common issue in JavaScript applications. They occur when references to objects that are no longer needed are not properly released from memory, causing the memory usage of the application to continuously increase over time.

To debug memory leaks in JavaScript applications, one popular approach is to use the event loop mechanism. The event loop is responsible for managing the execution of asynchronous operations in JavaScript, and it can be leveraged to track object references and identify potential memory leaks.

Here are the steps to debug memory leaks using the event loop:

1. **Identify the potential leak**: Start by profiling your application and identifying objects that should have been released from memory but are still being referenced. This can be done using browser developer tools or memory profiling tools like Chrome DevTools.

2. **Track object references**: Once you have identified the potential leak, you need to track the object references to understand where they are being retained. To do this, insert log statements or use the debugger to log or inspect the objects at different points in your code.

    ```javascript
    // Example code to track object references
    function someFunction() {
      const obj = { /* object you suspect is causing the memory leak */ };
      console.log(obj); // Log the object to track its references
    }
    ```

3. **Use the event loop**: JavaScript's event loop consists of a call stack and a task queue. By leveraging the event loop, you can schedule tasks asynchronously and observe any issues with object references and memory leaks. Start by running your code within a loop and monitoring the memory usage after each iteration.

    ```javascript
    // Example code to use the event loop for debugging memory leaks
    function runWithEventLoop() {
      setInterval(() => {
        // Run your code and monitor memory usage after each iteration
        someFunction();
      }, 1000);
    }
    runWithEventLoop();
    ```

4. **Release object references**: Once you have identified the code sections where object references are not being released, make sure to properly release them. This can include removing event listeners, clearing intervals or timeouts, and setting variables to `null` or `undefined` when they are no longer needed.

    ```javascript
    // Example code to release object references
    function cleanup() {
      // Remove event listeners
      element.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);

      // Clear intervals or timeouts
      clearInterval(interval);
    }
    ```

By following these steps, you can effectively use the event loop to debug memory leaks in your JavaScript applications. Remember to continuously monitor memory usage and test your fixes to ensure that the leaks are properly resolved.
