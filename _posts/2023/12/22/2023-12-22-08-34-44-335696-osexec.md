In Go, the `os/exec` package provides functionality for executing external commands. This allows you to run shell commands and interact with the command's standard input, output, and error streams.

## Using `os/exec`
To use the `os/exec` package, you first need to import it in your Go code:
```go
import "os/exec"
```

## Running a Command
You can execute a command using the `Command` function from the `os/exec` package:

```go
cmd := exec.Command("ls", "-l")
```

In this example, we're running the `ls -l` command.

## Handling Output
To capture the output of the command, you can use the `Output` function:

```go
output, err := cmd.Output()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
}
fmt.Println(string(output))
```

This code captures the output of the command and prints it to the console.

## Handling Input
You can also provide input to the command's standard input stream:

```go
cmd := exec.Command("cat")
stdin, _ := cmd.StdinPipe()
io.WriteString(stdin, "Hello, World!")
stdin.Close()
output, _ := cmd.CombinedOutput()
fmt.Println(string(output))
```

In this example, we use the `StdinPipe` function to get a pipe to the standard input stream of the command and write to it using `io.WriteString`.

## Conclusion
The `os/exec` package in Go provides a powerful and flexible way to execute external commands and interact with them. It is a useful tool for building command-line interfaces and interacting with other system processes.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/os/exec).

Now you have a good understanding of how to use `os/exec` in Go to execute external commands, handle their input and output, and work with the standard streams.
