Gentoo Linux is a powerful and flexible operating system that can be tailored to suit your specific needs. It is a rolling-release distribution and is known for its advanced package management system. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of installing Gentoo Linux on your system.

## Requirements
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
1. A computer with compatible hardware
2. Blank CD/DVD or USB drive for booting the installation
3. Internet connection
4. Basic knowledge of the command line

## Steps

### Step 1: Download the Installation Files
Download the latest Gentoo Linux installation ISO from the official [Gentoo website](https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Create Bootable Media
#### For CD/DVD:
Burn the ISO to a blank disc using your preferred burning software.

#### For USB Drive:
Use a tool like `dd` or a graphical application such as `Rufus` to write the ISO to the USB drive.

### Step 3: Boot from Installation Media
Insert the bootable media and restart your computer. Access the boot menu and choose to boot from the CD/DVD or USB drive.

### Step 4: Initial Setup
Once booted into the Gentoo live environment, follow the on-screen instructions to set up the network connection and prepare the installation environment.

### Step 5: Partitioning
Use the `fdisk` or `parted` command to create and configure the partitions for the installation. 

Here's an example using `fdisk`:
```shell
fdisk /dev/sdX
```
Replace `/dev/sdX` with the appropriate device identifier for your system.

### Step 6: Filesystem Configuration
Create filesystems on the partitions using `mkfs` commands. For example, to create an ext4 filesystem on the root partition:
```shell
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdXX
```
Replace `/dev/sdXX` with the appropriate device identifier for the root partition.

### Step 7: Installation
Mount the newly created filesystems and begin the installation process using the `chroot` command to switch into the new environment.

### Step 8: Configuration
Follow the Gentoo Handbook to configure the system, including setting up networking, installing a kernel, and configuring the bootloader.

### Step 9: Install Additional Software
Utilize the Portage package management system to install essential software and customize the system to your requirements.

### Step 10: Finishing Up
Once the installation is complete, exit the `chroot` environment, unmount the filesystems, and reboot into your new Gentoo Linux system.

Gentoo Linux offers an extensive repository of software and complete control over system configuration. It's a robust choice for users who want a personalized and optimized Linux experience.
