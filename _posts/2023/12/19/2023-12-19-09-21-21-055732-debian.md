## Introduction to Debian

**Debian** is a Unix-like **operating system**, which is composed entirely of free and open-source software. Its development is carried out by a community of volunteers from all over the world, and it adheres to the Debian Free Software Guidelines. Debian has **three main branches**:

- **Stable**: Designed for production use, this branch focuses on stability and reliability.
