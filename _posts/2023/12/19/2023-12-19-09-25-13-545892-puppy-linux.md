Puppy Linux can be run entirely from a USB drive or other portable media without the need for installation on a hard drive. This makes it a great choice for running on older computers or as a rescue system for troubleshooting and repairing other operating systems.

The distribution includes a variety of lightweight and efficient applications, making it suitable for basic computing tasks. Despite its small size, Puppy Linux provides a full range of features and capabilities typically found in larger distributions.

Puppy Linux is often used in embedded systems, as a recovery system, or as a way to breathe new life into older computers. Its minimal hardware requirements and portability make it a versatile choice for many different use cases.
