VeltOS is a modern Linux distribution designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for both desktop and server users. It offers a comprehensive set of software packages, a sleek desktop environment, and a robust system architecture.

## What Makes VeltOS Stand Out?

VeltOS stands out for several reasons. Firstly, it features the **runit init system**, which is known for its simplicity, speed, and reliability. This allows for efficient system initialization and management, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

Secondly, VeltOS leverages the powerful **xbps package manager** to handle software management. With a focus on simplicity, speed, and flexibility, xbps enables users to easily install, update, and remove packages while ensuring system stability.

On the server front, VeltOS is designed to deliver a robust and reliable platform for hosting web applications, databases, and other server-based services. Its efficient system architecture and powerful package management make it an ideal choice for server deployments.
