## Customization
Calculate Linux offers a high level of customization, allowing users to control nearly every aspect of the system. **Portage**, the heart of Gentoo's package management system, enables users to compile and install packages from source code, providing a highly customizable environment. This level of control makes Calculate Linux a popular choice for advanced users and system administrators who require specific configurations tailored to their needs.

## Package Management
Calculate Linux uses the **Portage** package management system, which allows for granular control over system packages. Users can install, upgrade, and remove software packages, ensuring that their systems are always up to date and secure. The Gentoo Portage tree contains a vast collection of pre-built packages, and users can also create their own packages to suit their requirements.

### Example: Installing a Package
To install a package using Portage, you can use the following command:
```bash
emerge package_name
```

## System Configuration
Calculate Linux provides a powerful set of tools for system configuration. The **Calculate Utilities** suite offers a range of graphical and command-line tools to manage various aspects of the system, including network settings, user accounts, and system maintenance. The **Calculate Console** provides a centralized interface for system administration, allowing users to configure and manage their systems efficiently.

## Security
Security is a critical aspect of any operating system, and Calculate Linux emphasizes the importance of maintaining a secure environment. The distribution provides built-in security features and tools to help users safeguard their systems against potential threats. Additionally, Calculate Linux benefits from the robust security measures inherent in the Gentoo ecosystem.
