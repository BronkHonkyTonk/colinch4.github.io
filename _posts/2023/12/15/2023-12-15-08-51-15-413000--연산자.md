Here's an example of how the `<<=` operator works:

```javascript
let x = 5; // 00000000000000000000000000000101
x <<= 2;   // Shift left by 2 positions: 00000000000000000000000000010100
// Now x is 20
```

In this example, the value of `x` is first shifted to the left by 2 positions and then assigned back to `x`. As a result, the new value of `x` becomes 20.
