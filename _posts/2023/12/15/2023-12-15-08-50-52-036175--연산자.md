The `*=` operator is a compound assignment operator in JavaScript that multiplies a variable by a given value and assigns the result to the variable itself.

### Syntax
```javascript
variable *= value;
```

### Example
Let's say we have a variable `x` with an initial value of 5. If we want to multiply `x` by 3 and assign the result back to `x`, we can use the `*=` operator as follows:
```javascript
let x = 5;
x *= 3; // Equivalent to: x = x * 3;
// Now, the value of x is 15
```

### Usage
The `*=` operator is commonly used when we want to update the value of a variable by multiplying it with another value.

### Conclusion
In this post, we discussed the `*=` operator in JavaScript, which is a convenient way to perform a multiplication operation and assignment in a single step.
