In Swift, both `weak var` and `weak self` are used to avoid creating strong reference cycles, also known as retain cycles, which can lead to memory leaks.

### `weak var`

The `weak var` keyword is used to declare a weak reference to an object that is not owned. This is commonly used when dealing with optional references, such as in delegate patterns or when capturing self within closures.

Example:
```swift
weak var delegate: MyDelegate?
```

In this example, the `weak var` keyword ensures that the `delegate` is not keeping a strong reference to the object it points to. If the referenced object is deallocated, the `delegate` will automatically be set to `nil`.

### `weak self`

On the other hand, `weak self` is used within closure capture lists to prevent strong reference cycles when capturing self inside a closure. This is commonly used when dealing with asynchronous operations, such as network requests or animations.

Example:
```swift
someAsynchronousOperation { [weak self] in
    self?.doSomething()
}
```

In this example, `[weak self]` captures `self` weakly within the closure, preventing a strong reference cycle.

### Key Differences

- `weak var` is used for declaring weak references to objects that you don't own, whereas `weak self` is used for capturing self weakly within closures to avoid strong reference cycles.
- `weak var` is used in property declarations, while `weak self` is used within closure capture lists.

In summary, `weak var` is used to declare weak references to objects, while `weak self` is used to capture self weakly within closures, preventing strong reference cycles in both cases.
