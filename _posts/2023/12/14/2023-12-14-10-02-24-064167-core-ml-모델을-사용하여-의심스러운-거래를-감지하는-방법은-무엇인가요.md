# Building a Suspicious Transaction Detector Using Core ML in iOS

## Part 1: Introduction to Core ML and the Problem Statement

In this blog post, we'll explore the basics of Core ML and the problem of detecting suspicious transactions in an iOS app. We'll discuss the importance of leveraging machine learning for fraud detection and outline the approach to using Core ML models for this purpose.

## Part 2: Selecting and Preparing the Core ML Model

In this post, we'll dive into the process of selecting a suitable Core ML model for fraud detection and preparing it for integration into the iOS app. We'll discuss considerations for choosing the right model and the steps involved in preparing the dataset for training.

## Part 3: Integrating the Core ML Model into the iOS App

This blog post will focus on the practical implementation of integrating the selected Core ML model into the iOS app. We'll cover the necessary steps to load the model, process input data, and make predictions to identify suspicious transactions in real time.

## Part 4: Fine-Tuning and Optimizing the Core ML Model

In this final post, we'll discuss the techniques for fine-tuning and optimizing the Core ML model to improve its accuracy and efficiency. We'll explore strategies for adapting the model to evolving fraud patterns and optimizing its performance within the iOS app.

Each blog post will include relevant code examples, links to useful resources, and practical tips for implementing fraud detection using Core ML in an iOS app.
