In C++, `constexpr` is a feature that allows the evaluation of expressions at compile time. It was introduced in C++11 and has been extended in later versions of the language.

## Introduction to constexpr

In C++11, `constexpr` was limited to a small subset of operations, and the expressions had to be simple enough to be evaluated at compile time. For example, you could declare a constant value using `constexpr`, but it was limited to basic arithmetic and logical operations.

```cpp
constexpr int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
```

## C++14 and extended constexpr

With the introduction of C++14, the `constexpr` keyword was extended to allow more complex operations, including loops and conditional statements.

```cpp
constexpr int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `fibonacci` function can be evaluated at compile time, as long as the input value is known at compile time as well.

## C++20 and consteval

C++20 introduced `consteval`, which is even more powerful than the extended `constexpr`. It guarantees that the function will be evaluated at compile time and can be used for a broader range of computations.

```cpp
consteval int factorial(int n) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}
```

In this example, the `factorial` function is guaranteed to be evaluated at compile time, providing a more flexible and powerful way to perform computations during compilation.

## Conclusion

`constexpr` in C++ has evolved significantly since its introduction in C++11. With the extensions introduced in C++14 and the addition of `consteval` in C++20, the language now provides more flexibility and power for compile-time computation, enabling more complex operations to be performed at compile time.
