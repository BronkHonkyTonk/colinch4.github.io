When used with the input stream (`std::istream`), `std::quoted` manipulator reads a string enclosed in quotes from the input stream, allowing you to extract quoted fields from the input.

Here's an example of how `std::quoted` can be used:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

int main() {
    std::string input = "John,Doe,\"123 Main St\",New York";
    std::istringstream iss(input);
    
    std::string name, surname, address, city;
    
    std::getline(iss, name, ',');
    std::getline(iss, surname, ',');
    iss >> std::quoted(address);
    std::getline(iss >> std::ws, city); // Using std::ws to consume leading white space
    
    std::cout << "Name: " << name << ", Surname: " << surname << ", Address: " << address << ", City: " << city << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::quoted` is used to extract the quoted address field from the input string, "123 Main St".

By using `std::quoted`, you can gracefully handle the quoted fields in a delimited string.
