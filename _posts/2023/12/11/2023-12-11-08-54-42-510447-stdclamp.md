```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    int value = 25;
    int lowerLimit = 10;
    int upperLimit = 50;

    int clampedValue = std::clamp(value, lowerLimit, upperLimit);

    std::cout << "Clamped value: " << clampedValue << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, if `value` is less than `lowerLimit`, it will be replaced by `lowerLimit`. If `value` is greater than `upperLimit`, it will be replaced by `upperLimit`. If `value` is within the range, it will remain unchanged.

`std::clamp` is a convenient and concise way to ensure that a value stays within specified bounds, eliminating the need for manual range checking.
