In C++, you can represent binary numbers directly by using the `0b` prefix. This feature was introduced in C++14.

## Syntax

The syntax for binary literals is as follows:
```c++
0b10101010
```

In the above example, `0b` denotes the beginning of a binary literal, followed by the sequence of binary digits representing the number. 

## Example

Here's a simple example to demonstrate the usage of binary literals:
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int binaryNumber = 0b10101010;
    std::cout << "Binary number: " << binaryNumber << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

When you run the above program, it will output:
```
Binary number: 170
```

In this example, `0b10101010` is a binary literal representing the decimal value 170.

By using binary literals, you can directly specify binary values in your C++ code, making it easier to work with binary data.

## Conclusion

Binary literals provide a convenient way to work with binary numbers in C++, making the code more readable and expressive.

For more information, you can refer to the [C++ Standard](https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard).
