### Defining Methods in a Swift Structure

In Swift, structures can have methods just like classes. Methods are functions that are associated with a particular type, allowing you to perform operations and modify properties of an instance of that type.

Here's an example of a structure with a method:

```swift
struct Car {
    var brand: String

    func startEngine() {
        print("Starting the engine of the \(brand)")
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Car` structure has a method called `startEngine` that simply prints a message about starting the engine.

### Calling Methods on a Swift Structure

To call a method on an instance of a structure, you use dot syntax. Here's how you would create an instance of the `Car` structure and call its `startEngine` method:

```swift
let myCar = Car(brand: "Tesla")
myCar.startEngine()
```

When you run this code, you'll see the following output:

```
Starting the engine of the Tesla
```

In this example, the `startEngine` method is called on the `myCar` instance of the `Car` structure.

By using methods in structures, you can organize your code more efficiently and make the structure instances more interactive.

I hope this helps! If you have further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask.
