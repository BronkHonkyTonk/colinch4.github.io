# Attaching Cookies to Requests Using Dio in Flutter

When working with network requests in a Flutter app, there might be situations where you need to attach cookies to the outgoing requests. This can be achieved using the Dio package, which provides a convenient way to make HTTP requests.

Here's a step-by-step guide to attaching cookies to requests using Dio in Flutter:

## Step 1: Add Dio to Your Flutter Project

First, you need to add the Dio package to your Flutter project. You can do this by adding the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dio: ^4.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## Step 2: Create a Dio Instance

Next, create an instance of Dio and configure it to handle cookies. You can do this by creating a Dio instance and setting up a `CookieManager`:

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';

void main() {
  Dio dio = Dio();
  dio.interceptors.add(CookieManager(CookieJar()));
}
```

The `CookieManager` and `CookieJar` classes provided by Dio handle the management and storage of cookies.

## Step 3: Attach Cookies to Requests

Now that you have a Dio instance set up to handle cookies, you can attach cookies to your requests by using the `options` parameter. When making a request, you can include the cookies in the `options` object:

```dart
Response response = await dio.get(
  'https://api.example.com/data',
  options: Options(
    headers: {
      "Cookie": "session_id=abcd1234; user_id=123"
    },
  ),
);
```

In this example, the `Cookie` header is set with the appropriate cookie values.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily attach cookies to requests using Dio in a Flutter app. Managing cookies is crucial when dealing with authenticated requests and sessions, and Dio provides a straightforward way to handle this.

That's it for attaching cookies to requests using Dio in Flutter. Happy coding!
