When dealing with large numbers, it can be difficult to read them quickly without separators. In C++14 and later, you can use digit separators to make large numbers more readable. Digit separators allow you to insert single quotes between digits in a numeric literal, making it easier to read.

### Syntax in C++

To use digit separators, simply insert a single quote between digits in a numeric literal. For example:

```c++
long population = 7'800'000'000;
```

In this example, the digit separator (single quote) is used to separate each group of three digits, making the number easier to read.

### Benefits of Using Digit Separators

Using digit separators helps improve the readability of large numeric literals in your code. It can also reduce the risk of human error when working with large numbers. By breaking down the number into smaller, more manageable chunks, digit separators can make your code easier to understand and maintain.

### Limitations

While digit separators can improve readability, it's important to note that they are only supported in C++14 and later versions. If your project requires compatibility with older compilers, you may need to find alternative ways to improve the readability of large numeric literals.

### Conclusion

In C++, digit separators provide a simple and effective way to improve the readability of large numeric literals. By using them, you can make your code easier to understand and maintain, ultimately contributing to the overall quality of your software.

By using digit separators in C++, you can make your large numeric literals more readable and maintainable.
