### Usage:
```cpp
template <typename... T>
void doSomething(T&&... args) {
  using indices = std::index_sequence_for<T...>;
  // Use indices to expand args pack
  // ...
}
```

In the above example, `std::index_sequence_for` generates an `index_sequence` with indices from 0 to sizeof...(T) - 1. This can be used to expand parameter packs or access elements in a tuple or array.

`std::index_sequence` and its related utilities provide a powerful mechanism for metaprogramming in C++.

For more information, you can refer to the [C++ reference for std::index_sequence](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/index_sequence).
