In C++, enumerations are a way to create a named integer type. Prior to C++11, enumerations were declared using the traditional unscoped syntax, which could lead to naming conflicts and unwanted implicit conversions.

In C++11, the scoped enumeration feature was introduced to address these issues. Scoped enumerations, also known as *enum class*, provide better encapsulation and type safety guarantees in comparison to traditional unscoped enumerations.

## What are Scoped Enumerations?

Scoped enumerations are declared using the `enum class` syntax. Unlike traditional unscoped enums, the enumerators in a scoped enumeration are not automatically placed in the enclosing scope. They are strongly typed and do not implicitly convert to integers or other enumeration types.

```c++
enum class Color { Red, Green, Blue };
```

## Benefits of Scoped Enumerations

### 1. Improved Type Safety
Scoped enumerations provide stronger type checking, preventing inadvertent conversions between different enumeration types and reducing bugs related to accidental misuse of enumerations.

### 2. Encapsulation
The enumerators in a scoped enumeration are encapsulated within the scope of the enumeration, preventing naming conflicts with other symbols in the same scope.

### 3. Explicit Qualification
Access to enumerators of scoped enumerations requires explicit qualification with the enumeration type, making the code more readable and self-documenting.

## Usage Example

Let's see how scoped enumerations can be used in practice:

```c++
#include <iostream>

enum class Status { OK, Error };

void processStatus(Status status) {
    switch(status) {
        case Status::OK:
            std::cout << "Operation successful\n";
            break;
        case Status::Error:
            std::cout << "Error occurred\n";
            break;
    }
}

int main() {
    processStatus(Status::OK);
    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

Scoped enumerations provide a safer and more robust way to define and use enumerations in C++. By leveraging the `enum class` syntax, developers can benefit from improved type safety, encapsulation, and self-documenting code.
