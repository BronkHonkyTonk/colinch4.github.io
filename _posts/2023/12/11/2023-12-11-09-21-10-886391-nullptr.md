Before the introduction of `nullptr`, the `NULL` macro or plain `0` was commonly used to represent a null pointer. However, using `nullptr` is preferred because it has a distinct type, `std::nullptr_t`, and can be used in contexts where the old-style `NULL` or `0` might lead to ambiguities or errors.

Here's an example of using `nullptr` in C++:

```c++
int* ptr = nullptr;  // initializing a pointer with nullptr
```

In this example, `ptr` is assigned a null pointer using `nullptr`.

Using `nullptr` instead of `NULL` or `0` can improve code readability and help catch certain types of errors, making it a recommended practice in modern C++ programming.
