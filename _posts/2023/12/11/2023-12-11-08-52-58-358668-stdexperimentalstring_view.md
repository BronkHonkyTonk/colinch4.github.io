In C++, `std::experimental::string_view` is a non-owning view over a sequence of characters. It provides a read-only view of a contiguous sequence of characters and is particularly useful for passing substrings of strings to functions without the need to create a new string.

## Features and Benefits

- **Non-owning View**: Unlike `std::string`, `std::experimental::string_view` does not own the underlying character sequence.
- **Cost-effective**: Since it doesn't allocate memory or make any copies, it's efficient for passing strings to functions and for comparisons.
- **Compatibility**: It's compatible with existing code that accepts `std::string` and provides a safer, more efficient alternative to pointer/length pairs.

## Usage

### Creating `std::experimental::string_view`

You can create a `std::experimental::string_view` from a `const char*` or a `std::string`:

```c++
std::string_view view1 = "Hello, World!";
std::string_view view2 = std::string("Hello, C++");
```

### Operations on `std::experimental::string_view`

- Accessing characters using `operator[]`
- Obtaining the length using `size()` or `length()`
- Substring operations using `substr()`
- Comparisons using `operator==` and `operator!=`

### Example

```c++
void print_string_view(std::string_view view) {
    for (char c : view) {
        std::cout << c;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::string str = "Hello, C++";
    print_string_view(str);
    return 0;
}
```

## Availability

`std::experimental::string_view` is available in the C++17 standard. To use it, ensure that you compile with the appropriate version of the C++ standard library that supports C++17.

For more details, refer to the [official C++ reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/basic_string_view).

Using `std::experimental::string_view` can improve code efficiency and reduce unnecessary string copies, making it a valuable addition to C++ when working with string views.
