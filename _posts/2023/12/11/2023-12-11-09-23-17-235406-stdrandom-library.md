The C++ standard library provides the `std::random` library for random number generation. This library offers various engines and distributions for producing random numbers with different properties.

### Random Number Engines
`std::random` includes several engines such as `linear_congruential_engine`, `mersenne_twister_engine`, `subtract_with_carry_engine`, and others. These engines generate a sequence of uniformly-distributed unsigned integers with a specific range and period.

### Random Number Distributions
The library also provides distributions including `uniform_int_distribution`, `uniform_real_distribution`, `normal_distribution`, and more. These distributions transform the output of a random number engine into numbers with different statistical properties, such as uniform or normal distribution.

### Example Usage
Here is an example of how to use `std::random` to generate random numbers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <random>

int main() {
    // Create a random number engine
    std::mt19937 rng(std::random_device{}());

    // Create a uniform distribution
    std::uniform_real_distribution<double> dist(0.0, 1.0);

    // Generate a random number
    double random_number = dist(rng);

    // Print the random number
    std::cout << "Random number: " << random_number << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use the Mersenne Twister engine (`std::mt19937`) and a uniform real distribution to generate a random number between 0.0 and 1.0.

The `std::random_device` is used to obtain a non-deterministic seed for the random number engine.

By using the `std::random` library, developers can easily generate random numbers with various distributions for different applications.
