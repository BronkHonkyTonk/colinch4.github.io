## Introduction
In this blog post, we will explore how to use instance methods in Python classes.

## Definition
Before we dive into usage, let's clarify what instance methods are in Python. **Instance methods** are functions that are defined inside a class and are used to manipulate instance variables.

## Usage
To use an instance method, we first need to create an instance of the class. Then, we can call the instance method using the dot notation, passing any required arguments.

Here's an example of a simple `Car` class with an instance method `drive`:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def drive(self, distance):
        print(f"Driving {distance} miles in the {self.make} {self.model}")
```

Now, let's create an instance of the `Car` class and call the `drive` method:

```python
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry")
my_car.drive(50)
```

The output of the above code will be:
```
Driving 50 miles in the Toyota Camry
```

## Conclusion
Instance methods are a powerful feature of Python classes that allow us to define operations that can be performed on an instance of a class. By using instance methods, we can encapsulate the behavior of objects and make our code more readable and maintainable.
