In this blog post, we will discuss how to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) using the net/http package in Go. CORS is a security feature implemented in web browsers to prevent unauthorized web applications from accessing resources on a different origin.

## What is CORS?

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows many resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. It is a security feature implemented in web browsers to prevent unauthorized web applications from accessing resources on a different origin.

## Enabling CORS in Go

To enable CORS in a Go web server, we can use the `net/http` package to set the necessary response headers. The following example demonstrates how to enable CORS for all origins.

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	// Define a handler function
	handler := http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		// Set CORS headers
		w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
		w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE")
		w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type")

		// Handle the request
		// ...
	})

	// Set the handler for a specific route
	http.Handle("/some-route", handler)

	// Start the server
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a handler using `http.HandlerFunc` and set the CORS headers using the `w.Header().Set` method before handling the request.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we discussed how to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) using the net/http package in Go. By setting the appropriate response headers, we can enable CORS for our web server, allowing it to securely interact with web applications from different origins.

For more detailed information, refer to the official documentation of the `net/http` package in Go.
