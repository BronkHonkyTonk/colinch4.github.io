Consider a simple tuple:

```c++
std::tuple<int, std::string, float> data{42, "Hello", 3.14f};
```

Using structured bindings, we can directly extract and assign names to the elements as follows:

```c++
auto [value, message, pi] = data;
```

In this example, `value`, `message`, and `pi` are the names assigned to the elements 42, "Hello", and 3.14, respectively.

Structured bindings offer several benefits, including improved code readability, reduced potential for errors when accessing elements, and the ability to work with complex data structures more easily.

Structured bindings have been available since C++17 and have become a popular feature due to their ability to simplify code that deals with complex data structures.
