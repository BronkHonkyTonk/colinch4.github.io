In SQL, **NON-EQUI JOIN** is a type of join condition where a relationship between two tables is established using comparative operators other than the equal sign. Unlike the **EQUI JOIN** which uses the equal sign to match rows based on specified columns, NON-EQUI JOIN uses operators like greater than, less than, or not equal to instead of equals.

## Advantages of NON-EQUI JOIN:

1. **Flexible Criteria**: NON-EQUI JOIN allows us to join tables based on flexible criteria, not limited to equality.

2. **Versatility**: It can be used to compare values using operators like greater than, less than, and not equal to, enabling a broader range of data comparisons.

## Example:

Suppose we have two tables, *employees* and *salaries*, and we want to retrieve details of employees whose salaries are greater than the average salary in the *salaries* table. We can achieve this using NON-EQUI JOIN as shown in the SQL query below:

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name, s.salary
FROM employees e
JOIN salaries s ON s.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM salaries)
WHERE e.employee_id = s.employee_id;
```

In this example, the NON-EQUI JOIN condition is `ON s.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM salaries)`, which compares each salary in the *employees* table to the average salary in the *salaries* table.

Using NON-EQUI JOIN opens up a new dimension for querying and analyzing data, providing a powerful tool for complex data retrieval and analysis.

For more information, you can refer to the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/join.html).

Now, you can confidently use the NON-EQUI JOIN to unleash the full potential of SQL joins!
