# Understanding Inner Join in SQL

In SQL, the INNER JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. It retrieves rows from both tables that satisfy the join condition.

## Syntax
The basic syntax for an INNER JOIN in SQL is as follows:
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

## Example
Consider the following two tables, `employees` and `departments`:

`employees` table:
| emp_id | emp_name | dept_id |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 1      | John     | 101     |
| 2      | Alice    | 102     |
| 3      | Bob      | 101     |

`departments` table:
| dept_id | dept_name |
|---------|-----------|
| 101     | HR        |
| 102     | IT        |

To retrieve the names of employees along with their department names, you can use the INNER JOIN as follows:
```sql
SELECT employees.emp_name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id;
```

This will produce the result:
| emp_name | dept_name |
|----------|-----------|
| John     | HR        |
| Alice    | IT        |
| Bob      | HR        |

In this example, the INNER JOIN combines the `employees` and `departments` tables based on the `dept_id` column, and retrieves the matching rows from both tables based on the common department ID.

With INNER JOIN, you can effectively retrieve only the rows for which there is a match in both tables, based on the specified condition.

For more information on the INNER JOIN clause in SQL, refer to the official [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/join.html).

This is a simple explanation on how to use the INNER JOIN clause in SQL to combine data from multiple tables based on a related column.
