In SQL, a **CROSS JOIN** is used to combine all rows from two or more tables, resulting in a Cartesian product. This means that every row from the first table is matched with every row from the second table, creating a new table with a number of rows equal to the product of the number of rows in the two tables.

### Syntax
The basic syntax for a CROSS JOIN is as follows:
```
SELECT * 
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

### Example
Suppose we have two tables, `employees` and `departments`, with the following data:
```
employees
+----+-----------+
| id | name      |
+----+-----------+
| 1  | Alice     |
| 2  | Bob       |
+----+-----------+

departments
+----+------------+
| id | department |
+----+------------+
| 1  | Sales      |
| 2  | Marketing  |
+----+------------+
```
If we apply a CROSS JOIN to these two tables, the resulting table will contain:
```
+----+--------+----+------------+
| id | name   | id | department |
+----+--------+----+------------+
| 1  | Alice  | 1  | Sales      |
| 1  | Alice  | 2  | Marketing  |
| 2  | Bob    | 1  | Sales      |
| 2  | Bob    | 2  | Marketing  |
+----+--------+----+------------+
```

### Use Cases
- When a combination of all rows from two or more tables is needed to perform analysis or data processing.
- In scenarios where a Cartesian product is required, such as for generating all possible combinations. 

### Conclusion
A **CROSS JOIN** in SQL is a powerful tool for combining data from multiple tables, and it produces a result set containing the Cartesian product of the input tables. However, it can generate a large number of rows, so it should be used judiciously.
