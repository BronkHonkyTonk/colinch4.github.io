Angular Forms provide a convenient way to handle user input and validation. In this post, we will explore how to set an Angular form to view mode, allowing users to see but not edit the form fields.

## Prerequisites
Before we dive into view mode, make sure you have basic knowledge of creating forms in Angular.

## Setting up a Form
Assuming you have an Angular application with a form already set up, let's consider a simple example of a user profile form.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { FormGroup, FormControl } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-profile',
  templateUrl: './user-profile.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./user-profile.component.css']
})
export class UserProfileComponent {
  userProfileForm = new FormGroup({
    firstName: new FormControl('John'),
    lastName: new FormControl('Doe'),
    email: new FormControl('johndoe@example.com')
  });
}
```

In this example, we have a form with fields for first name, last name, and email.

## Setting a Form to View Mode
To set the form to view mode, we can utilize the `[readonly]` attribute in HTML.

```html
<form [formGroup]="userProfileForm">
  <label for="firstName">First Name</label>
  <input id="firstName" formControlName="firstName" [readonly]="true">

  <label for="lastName">Last Name</label>
  <input id="lastName" formControlName="lastName" [readonly]="true">

  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <input id="email" formControlName="email" [readonly]="true">
</form>
```

By adding the `[readonly]="true"` attribute to the form fields, we set the form to a view mode, allowing users to see the existing data without being able to modify it.

## Conclusion
In this post, we've looked at how to set an Angular form to view mode, providing a read-only experience for users while still displaying the form's data. This can be useful for displaying profile information or any data that should not be editable.

By understanding this concept, you can enhance the user experience in your Angular applications.
