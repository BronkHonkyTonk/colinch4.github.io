## Introduction to HTML5

HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and comes with new features, improved semantics, enhanced multimedia support, and more dynamic and interactive elements.

### Key Features of HTML5

1. **Semantics**: HTML5 introduces new semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`, making it easier to structure and define the content of web pages.

```html
<header>
  <h1>Welcome to our website</h1>
</header>
```

2. **Audio and Video Support**: HTML5 provides native support for embedding audio and video content directly into web pages without the need for third-party plugins.

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

3. **Canvas and SVG**: HTML5 introduces the `<canvas>` element for drawing graphics and animations, and the ability to integrate scalable vector graphics (SVG) directly into web pages.

```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
```

## Introduction to CSS3

CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is used to style and layout web pages. CSS3 is the latest version of CSS and brings with it a wide range of new features, including enhanced layout capabilities, animations, and improved design options.

### Key Features of CSS3

1. **Flexbox**: CSS3 introduces the flexbox layout model, providing a more efficient way to arrange, align, and distribute space among items in a container.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

2. **Transitions and Animations**: CSS3 allows for the creation of smooth transitions and animations, improving the user experience and interactivity of web pages.

```css
.element {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
.element:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}

3. **Media Queries**: CSS3 introduces media queries, allowing for the adaptation of the layout to different devices and screen sizes, making web pages responsive and mobile-friendly.

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}

## Integration of HTML5 and CSS3

HTML5 and CSS3 are designed to work seamlessly together, with HTML5 providing the structure and content of web pages, while CSS3 handles the presentation and layout. By combining the power of HTML5 semantic elements with the styling capabilities of CSS3, developers can create visually stunning and well-structured web pages.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to our website</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <article>
      <h2>Latest News</h2>
      <p>Stay tuned for exciting updates!</p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <footer>

  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
