```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("John");
```

In this code, we define a function called `greet` that takes a `name` parameter. Inside the function, we use the `console.log` method to print the greeting message to the console.

To use this function, we call it with a specific name as an argument. In this case, we are calling `greet("John")`, which will output "Hello, John!" to the console.

This is just a basic example of how JavaScript functions can be implemented. The functionality can be expanded or modified based on your specific requirements.
