In this blog post, we will explore how to customize the appearance of the SkeletonView library in Swift. SkeletonView is a powerful library that allows us to easily add placeholder loading animations to our views while waiting for data to be loaded. By customizing the SkeletonView, we can match it to the design of our app and enhance the user experience.

## 1. Introduction

The SkeletonView library provides a convenient way to display loading animations for our views. By default, it uses a plain white color and a fade animation. However, we may want to customize the appearance of the SkeletonView to match the design of our app. In the following sections, we will explore different customization options.

## 2. Default Appearance

Before we dive into customization, let's first take a look at the default appearance of the SkeletonView. By simply adding the SkeletonView library to our project and applying it to a view, we can see a basic white loading animation.

```swift
import SkeletonView

// Apply SkeletonView to a view
view.showSkeleton()
```

## 3. Customizing SkeletonView

### Changing Colors

To change the colors of the SkeletonView, we can use the `SkeletonAppearance` class provided by the library. With this class, we can customize the color of the skeleton gradient or single-color skeleton. Here's an example of how to change the colors:

```swift
// Customize the gradient colors
SkeletonAppearance.default.gradient = SkeletonGradient(baseColor: .red, secondaryColor: .yellow)

// Customize the single-color skeleton
SkeletonAppearance.default.tintColor = .blue
```

### Adjusting Speed

The speed of the SkeletonView animation can be adjusted by setting the animation duration. By default, the duration is set to 1.5 seconds. We can change it to a value that suits our needs. Here's an example:

```swift
// Set the animation duration to 2 seconds
SkeletonAppearance.default.animation = SkeletonAnimation.default.animation(duration: 2.0)
```

### Configuring Animation Type

Besides adjusting the speed, we can also configure the animation type. SkeletonView provides various animation types like fade, slide, and scale. By default, the fade animation is used. To change it, we can use the following code:

```swift
// Configure the slide animation with a direction
SkeletonAppearance.default.transition = SkeletonTransitionStyle.slideRight
```

## 4. Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to customize the appearance of the SkeletonView library in Swift. By changing the colors, adjusting the speed, and configuring the animation type, we can create a more visually appealing loading animation that matches the design of our app. Customizing the SkeletonView enhances the user experience by providing a seamless loading experience.
